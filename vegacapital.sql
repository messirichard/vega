This is a noteworthy occasion for an open-source project like WordPress and one well worth celebrating. To mark the occasion, <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/\">WordPress communities across the world gathered</a> for parties and meetups in honor of the milestone.</p>\n\n<p>Altogether, there were 224 events globally, with <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/about/\">a few more of those still scheduled</a> to take place in some communities — attend one in your area if you can.</p>\n\n<p>If your city doesn’t have a WordPress meetup group, this is a great opportunity to start one!

It is worth noting, however, that WordPress cannot ensure you are compliant — this is still a site owner’s responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>The new privacy tools include a number of features focused on providing privacy and personal data management to all site users — asking commenters for explicit consent to store their details in a cookie, providing site owners with an easy way to publish a Privacy Policy, and providing data export and erasure tools to all site users that can be extended by plugins to allow the handling of data that they introduce.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more about these features and the other updates, read the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/17/4-9-6-update-guide/\">4.9.6 update guide</a>. You can also get involved in contributing to this part of WordPress Core by jumping into the #core-privacy channel in the<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\"> Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and following<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\"> the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Updates to the WordPress.org Privacy Policy</h2>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, WordPress.org itself has received <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/\">an updated Privacy Policy</a> to make clear what is being tracked and how your data is handled. Along with that, a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/cookies/\">Cookie Policy</a> has also been added to explain just what is collected and stored in your browser when using the site.</p>\n\n<p>These policies cover all sites on the WordPress.org network — including WordPress.org, WordPress.net, WordCamp.org, BuddyPress.org, bbPress.org, and other related domains and subdomains. It’s important to note that this does not mean that anything has changed in terms of data storage; rather that these documents clarify what data is stored and how it is handled.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>WordCamp US 2018 has <a href=\"https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/2018/05/29/speak-at-wordcamp-us/\">opened up speaker submissions</a> for the December event.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/05/15/wceu-live-stream-tickets/\">Live stream tickets are now available for WordCamp Europe</a>, happening on June 14-16.</li>\n	<li>Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress Core, is getting ever closer to the final stages with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/18/whats-new-in-gutenberg-18th-may/\">a major update</a> this month.</li>\n	<li>In preparation for Gutenberg, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/43309\">significant work has been done</a> to improve WordPress Core’s build process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6065\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"\n		\n		\n				\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n				\n								\n										\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"WordPress.org Privacy Policy Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-org-privacy-policy-updates/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 25 May 2018 08:06:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"privacy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:325:\"The WordPress.org privacy policy has been updated, hurray!

The Community Team has been hard at work helping communities around the world plan local anniversary parties.</p>\n\n<p>Check <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/\">the central anniversary website</a> to see if there’s already a party being planned near you. These parties are all organized by local communities — if there’s no local community in your area, you can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/#starting-a-new-meetup-com-group\">start one today</a> and host a party yourself.</p>\n\n<h2>Work has Started on a Gutenberg Migration Guide</h2>\n\n<p>With Gutenberg, the upcoming WordPress content editor, in rapid development, a lot of people have been wondering how they will convert their existing plugins to work with the new features. To mitigate the issues here and help people overcome any migration hurdles, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/04/26/your-help-wanted-gutenberg-migration-guide/\">a Gutenberg Migration Guide is underway</a> to assist developers with making their code Gutenberg-compatible.</p>\n\n<p>If you’d like to contribute to this guide, you can review <a href=\"https://github.com/danielbachhuber/gutenberg-migration-guide\">the existing documentation on GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/danielbachhuber/gutenberg-migration-guide/issues\">open a new issue</a> if you find something to add.</p>\n\n<h2>Theme Review Team Launches Trusted Authors Program</h2>\n\n<p>Reviews of themes submitted to the Theme Directory can take quite a while to complete. In order to combat this issue and to make the theme submission process smoother for everyone, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2018/04/30/trusted-authors-program/\">the Theme Review Team is introducing a Trusted Authors Program</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This program will allow frequent and reliable theme authors to apply for trusted status, allowing them to upload themes more frequently and to have their themes automatically approved. This will allow more high-quality themes to be added to the directory, as well as recognize the hard work that authors put in to build their themes.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to get involved with reviewing themes, you can read <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/\">their getting started guide</a>, follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/\">team blog</a> and join the #themereview channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/04/wordpress-4-9-5-security-and-maintenance-release/\">WordPress 4.9.5 was released</a> early this month, fixing numerous bugs and potential security issues.

If your background as a WordPress user is maintaining your website with the help of a page builder like Beaver Builder, Divi Builder, Elementor, or a similar plugin, this video will acquaint you with a few advantages that Gutenberg will bring to content creation in the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Peshev demonstrates how Gutenberg will make it easier for users to add and arrange page content that actual websites need, such as call-to-action buttons, testimonials, headers, and columns. In the past, users have relied on page builders, page templates, widgetized areas, shortcodes, custom meta boxes, and a host of disparate ways of trying to place content in a certain arrangement on a page. All of these seem rather clunky now when compared to Gutenberg&#8217;s united interface, despite the new editor&#8217;s less than perfect implementation.</p>\n<p>This video helps users understand the problems Gutenberg aims to solve. Peshev explains that page builder tools usually have heavy, complicated code bases in order to work around the problem of adding blocks of content to a page. Gutenberg is not replacing page builders. In fact, most of them are updating to provide a better experience for users in the Gutenberg era, so agencies should be able to utilize some of the same tools they have used in the past while setting clients loose in the new editorial framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The video was first published on my LinkedIn feed, which is comprised of business leaders, marketing experts, freelancers &#8212; many of whom use WordPress at work or for their own businesses,&#8221; Peshev said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They are not WordPress experts by any stretch, and rarely spend the time to test the &#8216;latest cool thing.&#8217; Odds are, some may have heard of it, but 95% haven&#8217;t even seen screenshots or demos of the new editorial experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a digital consultant and the CEO of DevriX, a 30+ person agency, Peshev understands the need to assure users that their traditional content editing experience will still be available if they don&#8217;t want to use Gutenberg. He has been preparing his clients who fall on both sides of the 5.0 release &#8211; either to move forward with the new editor or employ the Classic Editor to maintain the old one.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At DevriX, we&#8217;ve been testing every site we manage and maintain monthly,&#8221; Peshev said. &#8220;We want to ensure that there are no unexpected regressions or fatal errors we have to deal with last minute. That said, half of our customers can benefit by using Gutenberg &#8212; we&#8217;ve had continuous conversations with them and align the roadmap accordingly. Others, on the other hand, are purely content-driven, a traditional WYSIWYG experience, and we have the Classic Editor ready to go once Gutenberg is live.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Peshev said his agency has had to find the balance between improving the editorial experience as needed (for things like landing pages and more robust sections), versus ensuring the stability and consistency of content development for traditional editorial teams. He urges other agency owners to push forward and embrace the custom work that Gutenberg will require.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg is still in its infancy; there&#8217;s a lot of work left for us, agency owners and developers,&#8221; Peshev said. &#8220;Just as we used to build custom widgets, shortcodes, and page templates, we should build a series of Gutenblocks for every customer, prepare the corresponding templates, design the resulting front-end experience, and a lot more. Realistically, the editorial experience alone is a tiny chunk of the scope of WordPress development as a whole.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 17:08:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"HeroPress: Have Faith In Yourself\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=2607\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"https://heropress.com/have-faith-in-yourself/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=have-faith-in-yourself\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3622:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/081016-StaceyBartron-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: It may not all pan out, but I\'m along for the ride with WordPress in my backpack & I cannot wait to see where I end up.\" /><p>A couple years ago I was at Prestige Conf in Minneapolis. I noticed a young woman sitting by herself, patiently waiting for the talks to start, and thought I&#8217;d say hi. Her name was Stacey, and she was a freelance web developer and design expert. She was had recently quit her job to go freelance and this conference was part of her self-education.</p>\n<p>Our conversation brought back lots of memories of the excitement of when I first quit a good job to go freelance, but I was impressed by how much more attention to detail she&#8217;d paid than I had. I was a Bad Freelancer.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later it occurred to me that she might be willing to make the header banners for HeroPress essays. I asked, and she agreed at a price I could afford.  For a couple years now all of the banners you&#8217;ve seen on HeroPress were made by Stacey Bartron. No-one else has ever told me this, but I think the banners are pretty important to the essays and she&#8217;s done a wonderful, meaningful job.</p>\n<p>Stacey quit her job and went freelance because she had faith in her own abilities. Her skills were greater than the use to which they were being put at The Day Job. As it turns out, she was right.</p>\n<p>Check out Stacey&#8217;s very own HeroPress essay here:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-wordpress-fargo/\">Finding WordPress in Fargo</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Have Faith In Yourself\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Have%20Faith%20In%20Yourself&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fhave-faith-in-yourself%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Have Faith In Yourself\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fhave-faith-in-yourself%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fhave-faith-in-yourself%2F&title=Have+Faith+In+Yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Have Faith In Yourself\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/have-faith-in-yourself/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/081016-StaceyBartron-150x150.jpg&description=Have Faith In Yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Have Faith In Yourself\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/have-faith-in-yourself/\" title=\"Have Faith In Yourself\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/have-faith-in-yourself/\">Have Faith In Yourself</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 08:00:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"WPTavern: ClassicPress: Gutenberg Not Included\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83360\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wptavern.com/classicpress-gutenberg-not-included\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5995:\"<p>Depending on how far and deep you look, there is not a lot of positive sentiment surrounding Gutenberg. For Scott Bowler, the notion of merging Gutenberg into WordPress 5.0 represents a shift so <a href=\"https://medium.com/@scott.bowler83/classicpress-a-hard-fork-of-wordpress-without-gutenberg-1eeb62dd879c\">detrimental to the project</a>, he has forked WordPress into a new project called <a href=\"https://www.classicpress.net/\">ClassicPress</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The team at WordPress have decided to force Gutenberg into v5 of WordPress despite <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/gutenberg/reviews/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">massive push back by the WordPress community,</a>&#8221; Bowler said.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m in the &#8216;push back&#8217; camp. After my feedback on Gutenberg fell on deaf ears I realized that WordPress is no longer a community led project — major decisions are being made by an elite few.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Sadly, I decided it was time to move to a fork that doesn’t have Gutenberg as part of the core code. A quick search revealed nobody had taken the initiative so I decided to stop complaining and take action.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>In addition to ClassicPress, Bowler has <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/petition-to-wordpress-no-gutenberg-in-wordpress-core\">filed a petition</a> on Change.org requesting that Gutenberg not be merged into WordPress 5.0. As of publishing, the petition has 10 out of 100 signatures.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;This petition is to ask the WordPress team to keep Gutenberg out of the core of WordPress and instead keep it as a plugin for users to install,&#8221; Bowler said. &#8220;In addition, this petition asks that Gutenberg does not get integrated into the core until the community agrees that the time is right.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Bowler is not the only one who feels this way. Matt Cromwell, Head of Support and Community Outreach at <a href=\"https://wordimpress.com\">WordImpress</a>, suggests that Gutenberg be bundled with WordPress as a plugin similar to Aksimet. </p>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The more I think about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Gutenberg</a> as inevitable in WP Core, the more I am concerned that Core releases don\'t come often enough to support the kind of iterative improvements Gutes will need over the longterm.</p>&mdash; Matt Cromwell <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f393.png\" alt=\"🎓\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/271d.png\" alt=\"✝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@learnwithmattc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc/status/1030588894796865536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 17, 2018</a></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Shipping <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Gutenberg</a> as a default plugin like Akismet makes a lot of sense for several reasons.<br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png\" alt=\"✔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Allows for more iterative improvements<br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png\" alt=\"✔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Allows for quicker development<br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png\" alt=\"✔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Gives users more freedom of choice</p>&mdash; Matt Cromwell <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f393.png\" alt=\"🎓\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/271d.png\" alt=\"✝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@learnwithmattc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc/status/1030588896281653249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 17, 2018</a></blockquote>\n\n\n<p>If Gutenberg ships with WordPress 5.0, Bowler says he is committed to maintaining compatibility with the WordPress ecosystem, keeping the project up to date with security fixes, and letting the community dictate its development.</p>\n\n<p>ClassicPress is based on WordPress 4.9.8 and is not available to the public yet. It&#8217;s in a consultation phase that interested users can participate in through the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicPress\">ClassicPress subreddit</a>. <br /></p>\n\n<h2>Forks Are a Good Thing, But This One Doesn&#8217;t Make Sense</h2>\n\n<p>I used to think that forking WordPress is the equivalent of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_option\">nuclear option</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y6HcQcQWXU\">a presentation</a> by John James Jacoby in 2016 during WordSesh changed my perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Forking is a good thing as it allows people to take a project in their own direction. It opens the door for experimentation. If there are any lessons learned or improvements made, those can usually be pushed upstream to the main project.</p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">solutions available</a> that allow users and site managers to keep the classic editor in place until a transition can be made. There&#8217;s also a Classic Editor block within Gutenberg that provides a similar user experience to the Classic Editor. </p>\n\n<p>With options available to not use or at least delay Gutenberg from becoming the new editor, and that&#8217;s <strong>if</strong> it&#8217;s merged into WordPress 5.0, ClassicPress isn&#8217;t so much of a necessary fork but rather, a last ditch effort to raise awareness to not merge Gutenberg into core. And that&#8217;s an unfortunate reason to fork WordPress. </p>\n\n<p>*<strong>Updated 8/21/2018</strong>* First paragraph was edited to &#8220;For Scott Bowler, the notion of merging Gutenberg into WordPress 5.0 represents a shift so <a href=\"https://medium.com/@scott.bowler83/classicpress-a-hard-fork-of-wordpress-without-gutenberg-1eeb62dd879c\">detrimental to the project</a>, he has forked WordPress into a new project called <a href=\"https://www.classicpress.net/\">ClassicPress</a>.&#8221; </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 01:40:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WPTavern: Drupal.org Migrates Developer Tools to GitLab\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83338\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wptavern.com/drupal-org-migrates-developer-tools-to-gitlab\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4323:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-21-at-12.36.38-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: Drupal Association\n<p>The Drupal Association announced this week that Drupal.org will be <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/blog/developer-tools-initiative-part-5-gitlab-partnership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">migrating its developer tools to GitLab</a>. In selecting a partner for modernizing the project&#8217;s tooling, the association aimed to preserve the most valuable parts of Drupal&#8217;s workflow.

If the comments on that <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/blog/developer-tools-initiative-part-2-comparing-our-options\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> are any indication, the Drupal community was not excited about the selection. GitLab reached out to comment on the status of some of the blockers the association had identified and worked privately with Drupal representatives to resolve those issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They have escalated the internal priority of issues that blocked our adoption of GitLab, offered technical and financial support for the migration, and made a commitment to ongoing support for the Drupal project,&#8221; Drupal Association&#8217;s director of engineering Tim Hestenes Lehnen said. The team plans to migrate Drupal.org&#8217;s 45,000 projects to GitLab over the coming months.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By adding merge requests, contributing to Drupal will become much more familiar to the broad audience of open source contributors who learned their skills in the post-patch era,&#8221; Lehnen said. &#8220;By adding inline editing and web-based code review, it will be much easier to make quick contributions. This not only lowers the barrier to contribution for people new to our community, it also saves significant effort for our existing community members, as they&#8217;ll no longer need to clone work locally and generate patches.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see how the WordPress project might also benefit from collaborating on a platform like GitLab. In October 2017, after the company <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gitlab-raises-20-million-series-c-round-adds-matt-mullenweg-to-board-of-directors\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced a $20 million Series C round of funding</a> and appointed Matt Mullenweg to its board of directors, WordPress contributors speculated about whether the project would move to GitLab.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely something on our minds,&#8221; Mullenweg said when asked if GitLab and WordPress might collaborate in the future. &#8220;Core WordPress is still Trac and Subversion, so I think that it’s not our top priority this year, but in the future it’s definitely on the radar.”</p>\n<p>In 2016, GitLab worked to establish itself as the most welcoming platform for open source organizations after GitHub  <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gitlab-courts-open-source-project-maintainers-with-response-to-dear-github-letter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">failed to address open source maintainers&#8217; concerns</a> in a timely way. The company began actively courting disgruntled GitHub users following <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gitlab-courts-disgruntled-github-customers-with-response-to-recent-pricing-hike\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub&#8217;s May 2016 pricing hike</a>.</p>\n<p>GitLab&#8217;s efforts to resolve critical issues for Drupal.org demonstrates the company&#8217;s commitment to ensure open source projects have what they need. Drupal.org&#8217;s transparency throughout the decision to migrate its developer tools enabled the project to respond to the community&#8217;s request to make GitLab work. It also prompted GitLab representatives to reach out with more information on the project&#8217;s blockers. As WordPress will be looking to move its developer tools to a new platform in the future, following along with Drupal.org&#8217;s migration experience as it progresses should be a good learning opportunity.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 22:25:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"Matt: Distributed Office Politics\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48317\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"https://ma.tt/2018/08/distributed-office-politics/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:578:\"<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/18/distributed-teams-are-rewriting-the-rules-of-officeless-politics/\">This week I spoke with TechCrunch</a> about one facet of distributed work that differs from physical offices &#8212; the idea of &#8220;office politics.&#8221; I can&#8217;t claim that distributed work will solve everyone&#8217;s personal differences, but I do think it relieves some of the pressures that might come from forced cohabitation and environments that are prone to interruption.

Although you may not be able to tell from the frontend, behind the scenes the new block-based editor is powering the layout with custom blocks, allowing the Mimimi team to easily update various sections of their website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.luehrsen-heinrich.de/\">Luehrsen Heinrich</a>, a local ad agency, built the site with a custom theme and seven blocks tailored to support the Mimimi team&#8217;s editing requirements.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The general task was to create an elegant website that is very easy and fast to maintain and that will maybe later get a blog/news section,&#8221; Hendrik Luehrsen, CEO of Luehrsen Heinrich, said. &#8220;We knew our client has some amazingly creative and tech savvy people who trusted us. That made us confident to go into Gutenberg.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The site uses a background block that enables editors to create different background patterns and wavy separators. Luehrsen said it works with ‘InnerBlocks’, similar to columns, so it can host any other block.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Bildschirmfoto-2018-08-19-um-00.37.07.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The site also has a custom Discord block that dynamically fetches some settings to display a set of users from Discord, which Mimimi uses for internal communication. The block displays an updated team roster. Social media and game blocks enable editors to easily update text and images with the layout already set.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Bildschirmfoto-2018-08-19-um-00.38.55-e1534729837643.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I am pretty sure we could do the same layout to about 80% by combining columns, paragraphs, and images, but we didn’t want our client to fiddle around like in MS Word when you try to place an image,&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;So creating a simple layout block was a logical thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mimimi&#8217;s website also uses a custom Mailchimp signup block and a custom spacer block that offers more flexibility and responsive breakpoints.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All in all we (and our clients) are very happy with the result,&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;We can see the future of WordPress ahead with this block based editor. But there is still a very long way to go until we really have nothing to smooth out anymore. There are certain things, that still require a lot of work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>From a development perspective, Luehrsen said his team still struggles with the backend styles for the editor and that frontend and backend styles differ wildly because of that. They also haven&#8217;t yet found a maintainable, stable way of applying global styles to the Gutenberg editor. Other than those outstanding issues, the agency has enjoyed building for the new editor and has another Gutenberg-page product launching soon for a different set of clients.</p>\n<h3>Mimimi Games&#8217; Gutenberg Experience: Editors Appreciate the Block Concept but Still Encounter Usability Issues</h3>\n<p>Johannes Roth, CEO of Mimimi Games, said his team has used WordPress in the past and sees Gutenberg as a major improvement for editing content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I absolutely love it, honestly!&#8221; Roth said. &#8220;It&#8217;s so much easier to understand the setup of the page and to customize it. If the Gutenberg editor gets a few user experience improvements, I definitely see it being the new state of the art for maintaining pages. But knowing that it&#8217;s still not officially released, it has been super robust and easy to understand from my point of view.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Roth said his team appreciates the block setup, the ability to reorganize content, having small chunks of content to work on, and having custom tailored options per block.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are fewer distractions with weird toolbars and the focus is on content,&#8221; Roth said. &#8220;It also more closely resembles how we should think about splitting the formatting and decoration part from the content, as well as setting up proper pages for SEO friendliness.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Roth identified two things that the Mimimi team misses from the previous editor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pressing tab to indent bullet lists and shift tab to reverse</li>\n<li>Using ctrl+a to quickly select all text inside a block (it sometimes selects the whole page, which doesn&#8217;t help).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;The biggest issue with usability so far has been the combination of blocks and columns, which sometimes makes it really hard to hit the &#8216;&#8230;&#8217; icon because the mouseover zones get stacked,&#8221; Roth said.</p>\n<h3>Enabling Storytellers on the Modern Web: Why Luehrsen Heinrich Took the Leap into Gutenberg Development as an Agency</h3>\n<p>Luehrsen said his agency decided to board the Gutenberg train last year at WordCamp Europe, after ditching their own ideas for creating a new page builder.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One or two months before WCEU in Paris, we were sitting on a concept and an alpha version of our own page builder system that was frighteningly similar to the block based approach,&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;That Q&amp;A by Matt made us quickly realize that our project was already obsolete. We were lucky that we went pretty quickly through the five stages of grief (<a href=\"https://www.wp-munich.com/wordpress/gutenberg-structured-data/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this post</a> on structured data must have been “bargaining”). We reordered our priorities and started working with and on Gutenberg in the end of October or November of 2017.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Luehrsen Heinrich is a small agency of just four people who are all involved with Gutenberg in different ways. Luehrsen is an active contributor on the project, submitting <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/4118\">his first PR</a> over the Christmas holidays. The team also has a developer who knows block creation inside and out, a designer who designs the UX and style of their blocks, and a project manager who works with the clients on their Gutenberg editing requirements.</p>\n<p>Luehrsen said being a Gutenberg contributor helped immensely with learning block creation, despite having no prior experience with React and ES6.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Working with Gutenberg, contributing to the project and getting immediate feedback from the amazing Gutenberg team, helped us a lot in bootstrapping our process,&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;Our current block creation process builds heavily on the work Gary, Adam, Matias, and all the others have done, maybe with the exception that we are using LESS internally, and not SCSS. But from folder structure, to the build process, to the structuring of the file, we try to follow the Gutenberg repo style as closely as possible, as that makes debugging and finding issues very easy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After successfully making the jump to build Mimimi Games&#8217; new Gutenberg-powered website, Luehrsen&#8217;s team is on board for building more client sites with the new editor. He sees it as a way to deliver a better user experience at a better value for the client.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our clients share our belief that storytelling in the modern web is much more than just writing text,&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;TinyMCE as a &#8216;Rich Text&#8217; editor did an amazing job, but still, combining different types of media to a coherent story was a mess with metaboxes, shortcodes, and sometimes for teasers you even had to leave the edit screen. Gutenberg combines all of this in a nice, unobtrusive way. And, as always: If you can get to a good result in a faster way, that time saved is what the client is essentially buying.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 18:54:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Matt: Light Heretofore Unknown\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48313\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"https://ma.tt/2018/08/light-heretofore-unkown/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:567:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Yes, it is a press, certainly, but a press from which shall soon flow in inexhaustible streams the most abundant and most marvelous liquor that has ever flowed to relieve the thirst of man!

This process of rearranging blocks disrupts the flow of writing. </p>\n\n<p>There are a few ways to get around this issue. The first is to not press enter at the end of a paragraph so I can add the block that I want. </p>\n\n<p>The second is to type /image inside the paragraph block which will automatically convert it to an image block. This is convenient but it&#8217;s a power user shortcut that&#8217;s difficult to discover without someone telling you about it. It&#8217;s weird that using a shortcut can convert a paragraph block to an image block but the user interface option to convert it doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>\n\n<h3>Icons Not Associated With a Block Floating in Empty Space<br /></h3>\n\n<p>In the image below is a CloudUp embed block that has a video and below it are three icons. I sometimes think these icons are related to the block above it but instead, these icons are part of the add block placeholder UI. </p>\n\n<img />Block Icons Look Like They&#8217;re For Another Block\n\n<p>Granted, a list, image, and quote icon has nothing to do with embedding videos. At-a-glance, seeing these icons can lead to a bit of confusion. I don&#8217;t want to see those icons floating in empty space when I&#8217;m working on a block they&#8217;re not attached too. <br /></p>\n\n<h3>Losing Content Due to Autosave Disconnecting<br /></h3>\n\n<p>While writing a post working remotely, I noticed the Autosave button in Gutenberg was continuously flashing. I&#8217;ve experienced something similar in the classic editor and suspected that a connection issue must have happened although I was browsing the internet without a problem.</p>\n\n<p>I finished writing the post, added meta data, and a featured image. I copied all of the content on the post, refreshed the page, and confirmed I wanted to leave the page. It turns out, my suspicion was right. </p>\n\n<p>At some point, the autosave process stopped working and I lost half the post, including the meta data. I was able to paste the lost content into the editor and go about my day. </p>\n\n<p>The current editor has fail-safes in place to prevent the loss of content, such as using a browser&#8217;s local storage. I&#8217;m unsure if Gutenberg has the same fail-safes in place. So far, this has been the only time where I&#8217;ve lost content in Gutenberg due to autosave not working correctly. </p>\n\n<h3>Digging Through the Junk Drawer</h3>\n\n<p>In the classic editor, the tool bar stays in constant view. In Gutenberg, there are multiple areas on the screen where UI elements appear and disappear depending on where the cursor is. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to see the code version of the editor, you need to click the ellipsis on the top right corner and select it from a drop-down menu. To add a new block, you have to click the + symbol and either search or select from a menu. </p>\n\n<p>The combination of visiting different parts of the editor, browsing through menus, and selecting from multiple things sometimes feels like I&#8217;m going through the junk drawer in the kitchen looking for a utensil. This feeling occurs multiple times depending on the length of a post. </p>\n\n<h3>There&#8217;s Still a Ways to Go</h3>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been able to get used to the block concept and actually prefer it over the classic editor. However, there are certain tasks that are easier and faster to accomplish in the classic editor versus Gutenberg. </p>\n\n<p>For example, if you want to create a heading using existing text in Gutenberg, you have to select the text, click the Paragraph icon, select the heading block, and choose which heading you want. In the Classic editor, you select the text, click the preferred heading from an always visible drop-down menu and continue writing. </p>\n\n<p>These nuances to the writing flow, the user interface, and the experience of looking around for things is where I believe Gutenberg needs the most improvement. The bar has been set by the Classic editor but it has more than 10 years of iteration behind it. Hopefully, Gutenberg can reach or exceed that bar before it&#8217;s merged into core. <br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 22:32:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 3.6 Adds New Icons for All Core Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83242\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-3-6-adds-new-icons-for-all-core-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5014:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/08/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-17th-august/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 3.6</a> was released today, featuring a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/8916\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">design overhaul for the core icons</a> in the block inserter. The blocks now use <a href=\"https://material.io/tools/icons/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Material icons</a>, which offer more options than the Dashicons. This update also improves the icons for the core embeds, which now display the corresponding icon for each embed service.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg testers <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3736\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">logged an issue</a> regarding the limitations of Dashicons last year, citing the small number available, the inadequacy of their size, and the generic substitutions for embed service icons. The Gutenberg team <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3736#issuecomment-355267596\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">closed the ticket</a>, saying there was no sign in testing that showed the icons to be a problem and that potential contributors would need to &#8220;revisit with evidence&#8221; if they wanted to re-open the issue.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether the team received the evidence or testing required to make this change but the icons become problematic in other ways. As the community started extending Gutenberg, block icon duplication became a problem, due to the limited number of Dashicons available.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We really need block icons to move away from using dashicons as soon as possible,&#8221; Gutenberg technical lead Matías Ventura said in another discussion on a proposed solution. &#8220;We are already seeing plugins adding blocks where the icon overlap is very high just because of the limited icons set, which reduces clarity for users very drastically.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/8719\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Switching to Material icons</a> solves this problem, ensuring there are unique icons for each block. The inserter design has also been updated as part of this overhaul. Previously, icons appeared with a grey background, as seen below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-17-at-12.51.51-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The old design suddenly looks rather dated in comparison to Gutenberg&#8217;s 3.6 update, which allows for more whitespace around the icons:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-17-at-12.53.39-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The new embed icons are also greatly improved from previous versions of the plugin:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-17-at-4.09.01-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The new icons aim to encourage people creating their own blocks to supply their own SVG,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;The hope is to make sure we can avoid multiple cases of duplicated icons diminishing the overall ability to quickly scan blocks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ventura said Gutenberg will retain the ability to specify a Dashicon slug in the Block API but he encourages developers to &#8220;supply custom SVGs (or draw from the material icon pool) as much as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 3.6 also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/8279\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">adds several new keyboard shortcuts</a>, including inserting a new block before/after the current block, toggling the inspector settings, removing a block, and displaying a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/8316\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new modal help menu</a>. The modal can be launched from the Settings button at the top of the editor and users can scroll through all available shortcuts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-17-at-4.16.53-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also fixes many bugs that users have reported. Gutenberg will now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/8446\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">open a new preview window</a> if the prior window has been closed. It will also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/9015\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bring the preview tab to the front</a> when clicking the preview button. Version 3.6 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/9010\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fixes several usability issues</a> that testers found with the permalink UI.

In the past a file had to be placed in the &#8220;WP Super Cache plugins directory&#8221; so that it would be loaded correctly but in this release I&#8217;ve added new actions that will allow you to load code from other directories too.</p>\n\n<p>Use the <strong>wpsc_add_plugin</strong> action to add your plugin to a list loaded by WP Super Cache. Use it like this:<br /></p>\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">do_action( \'wpsc_add_plugin\', WP_PLUGIN_DIR . \'/wpsc.php\' )</pre>\n\n<p>You can give it the full path, with or without ABSPATH. Use it after &#8220;init&#8221;. It only needs to be called once, but duplicates will not be stored.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar fashion, use <strong>wpsc_delete_plugin</strong> to remove a plugin.</p>\n\n<p>The release also makes it much simpler to modify the cookies used by WP Super Cache to identify &#8220;known users&#8221;. This is useful to identify particular types of pages such as translated pages that should only be shown to certain users. For example, visitors who have the English cookie will be shown cached pages in English. The German cookie will fetch German cached pages. The action <strong>wpsc_add_cookie</strong> makes this possible.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">do_action( \'wpsc_add_cookie\', \'language\' );</pre>\n\n<p>Execute that in your plugin and WP Super Cache will watch out for the language cookie. The plugin will use the cookie name <em>and</em> value in determining what cached page to display. So &#8220;language = irish&#8221; will show a different page to &#8220;language = french&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Use <strong>wpsc_delete_cookie</strong> to remove a cookie. Cache files won&#8217;t be deleted. It&#8217;s doubtful they&#8217;d be served however because of the hashed key used to name the filenames.<br /></p>\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">do_action( \'wpsc_delete_cookie\', \'language\' );</pre>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re going to use either of the plugin or cookie actions here I recommend using <strong>Simple Caching</strong>. While the plugin will attempt to update mod_rewrite rules, it is much simpler to have PHP serve the files. Apart from that, any plugins loaded by WP Super Cache will be completely skipped if Expert mode is enabled.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2008/10/24/wp-super-cache-084-the-garbage-collector/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector\">WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2009/01/09/wp-super-cache-087/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.7\">WP Super Cache 0.8.7</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2010/02/08/wp-super-cache-099/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.9.9\">WP Super Cache 0.9.9</a></li></ul></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://odd.blog/2018/08/17/wp-super-cache-1-6-3/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 16:36:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Donncha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: WordPress for iOS 10.6 Adds A Detailed Site Activity Log\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83231\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-10-6-adds-a-detailed-site-activity-log\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3569:\"<p>In the past few months, the <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/mobile/\">WordPress mobile application</a> for iOS has quietly received a steady round of improvements. Version 10.5 increased its compatibility with Gutenberg. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-and-gutenberg-dont-get-along\">Earlier this year</a>, Gutenberg and the iOS app didn&#8217;t get along particularly well. </p>\n\n<p>About a month ago in 10.4, an activity log was added that allows users to see a detailed list of activities on their sites. In 10.6, the most recent version, the activity log is now available for free WordPress.com sites and those connected with Jetpack.</p>\n\n<img />WordPress for iOS Activity Log\n\n<p>As you can see in the screenshot above, comment activity, post and page activity, and generally all site activity shows up in the log. </p>\n\n<p>Selecting an activity displays detailed information such as who performed the action, their role, IP address, and other information depending on the activity. The log displays the last 20 activities performed on the site.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear exactly what data the activity log monitors, where or if it&#8217;s saved, how it&#8217;s generated, and how users can turn it off. Browsing around the mobile app, I was unable to find a way to disable the activity log.</p>\n\n<h2>The WordPress Mobile Team is Quiet But Busy</h2>\n\n<p>If it weren&#8217;t for the change logs on the iTunes Store, it would be difficult for users to know what&#8217;s going on with the app. The project&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS\">GitHub page</a> is buzzing with activity, but more public facing means of communication are not. <br /></p>\n\n<p>The WordPress for iOS app <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wordpressios?lang=en\">Twitter account</a> has been dormant since May. The <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/blog/\">WordPress Mobile apps blog</a> hasn&#8217;t published a new post since 2016 and some of the posts that highlight new features are on the official <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com blog</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, not every release requires a full-featured post, but the activity log is a feature that I think warrants one. An explanation of why it was created, how it works, and how users not interested in it can disable it. </p>\n\n<p>The WordPress for iOS app is <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/contribute/\">open source</a> and available for free from the <a href=\"https://search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZContentLink.woa/wa/link?mt=8&path=apps%2fWordPress\">Apple iTunes App Store</a>. You can also find links to the Android and Desktop apps on the <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com Apps site</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>*Update*</h2>\n\n<p>After this article was published, I was given a <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/activity-log/\">link to a support document</a> on the Jetpack website that explains the activity log feature in more detail.

The New York Times published an article titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/business/media/sandy-hook-conspiracies-leonard-pozner.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This Company Keeps Lies About Sandy Hook on the Web</a>,&#8221; setting off a hailstorm of angry posts on social media that demanded Automattic take action.</p>\n<p>“Posting conspiracy theories or untrue content is not banned from WordPress.com, and unfortunately this is one of those situations,” Automattic told the New York Times in a statement. “It is a truly awful situation, and we are sympathetic to the Pozner family.”</p>\n<p>Leonard Pozner, father of Sandy Hook Elementary shooting victim Noah Pozner, claims that images of his son were being misused on a WordPress.com-hosted site where the author denied the tragedy and called his son a crisis actor. He filed copyright infringement claims on the images used on the conspiracy site in an attempt to get the content removed.</p>\n<p>Automattic examined the images and determined that there was nothing illegal about their use on the site. The company sent Pozner a reply that said, &#8220;because we believe this to be fair use of the material, we will not be removing it at this time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the New York Times article, Automattic admits its insensitivity in handling the situation, apologizing to the family, but said the posts in question &#8220;are not violating any current user guidelines, or copyright law.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The pain that the family has suffered is very real and if tied to the contents of sites we host, we want to have policies to address that,&#8221; Automattic told the New York Times.</p>\n<h3>WordPress.com Updates it Privacy Policy, Banning Malicious Publication of Unauthorized, Identifying Images of Minors</h3>\n<p>After consulting with the Internet Archive&#8217;s Wayback Machine, it appears WordPress.com has quietly updated its privacy policy, which now includes unauthorized images of minors on the list of things the platform considers private information. The <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201091159/https://en.support.wordpress.com/private-information/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">previous policy</a> appears below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-16-at-8.29.14-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/private-information/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">updated policy</a> adds &#8220;the malicious publication of unauthorized, identifying images of minors&#8221; to that list.</p>\n<p>Searching Twitter for discussion surrounding Sandy Hook conspiracy sites turns up a slew of tweets calling on people to boycott WordPress.com and other Automattic products. However, there are also responses on the other end of the spectrum, with Sandy Hook conspiracy theorist supporters retweeting a user who claims that WordPress.com has shut down his site.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Minutes ago this morning, I discovered that WordPress has unilaterally and without warning shut down Fellowship of the Minds for alleged violations of \"Terms of Service\".

These events are outlined in <a href=\"http://memoryholeblog.org/2018/08/14/wordpress-automattic-shuts-down-fellowshipoftheminds/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a post on memoryholeblog.org</a>, a site maintained by James F. Tracy, a former professor of journalism and media who became known for his research questioning the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre and Boston Marathon bombing. Tracy&#8217;s blog was also removed from WordPress.com in 2016 for violation of Automattic’s Terms of Service.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-16-at-8.48.40-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Automattic did not detail specific infractions in either case of removal. It&#8217;s not clear whether the site referenced in the New York Times article was removed for a new offense or a previous one. The removals seem to have coincided with WordPress.com&#8217;s updated privacy policy, but Automattic&#8217;s PR department has not responded to a request for comment on the matter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As with Automattic’s treatment of MHB, FOTM’s disappearance strongly suggests how WordPress.com’s policies are being tailored to placate outside parties whose foremost interest is in stifling political speech on potential high crimes, and how in this instance such poorly-founded grounds for censorship have triumphed over free speech,&#8221; Tracy said.</p>\n<p>Historically, Automattic has been a stalwart defender of free speech on the web. It&#8217;s outlined as part of the <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/user-guidelines/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com&#8217;s User Guidelines</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress.com strongly believes in freedom of speech. We have a vast audience spread across many cultures, countries and backgrounds with varying values and our service is designed to let users freely express any ideas and opinions without us censoring or endorsing them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether Automattic changed its policy in response to this situation or whether this situation revealed holes in it that the company wanted to improve. In either case, the policy change seems to have enabled Automattic to do what outraged onlookers wanted them to do, except outside of the emotional mandate issued by the New York Times.</p>\n<p>Without the new privacy policy in place, removal of a site based on offensive material constitutes censorship. Automattic had already determined that the post using the child&#8217;s image, while distasteful and offensive, was fair use for the material. The image had likely already been used thousands of times by news organizations with a different narrative attached to it that is more in alignment with the majority&#8217;s view of the tragedy.</p>\n<p>As it is a private company, Automattic&#8217;s terms of service do not have to reflect the full freedom of speech allowed by the law. However, the company has always upheld its reputation in the past as an uncompromising defender of its users when presented with requests for censorship.</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180206/10271639166/why-allegedly-defamatory-content-wordpresscom-doesnt-come-down-without-court-order.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post on Techdirt</a>, Automattic general counsel Paul Sieminski and Holly Hogan detail how WordPress.com handles its role in managing intermediary liability when the company receives complaints regarding defamatory content:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Making online hosts and other intermediaries like WordPress.com liable for the allegedly defamatory content posted by users is often criticized for burdening hosts and stifling innovation. But intermediary liability isn&#8217;t just bad for online hosts. It&#8217;s also terrible for online speech. The looming possibility of writing a large check incentivizes hosts like Automattic to do one thing when we first receive a complaint about content: Remove it. That decision may legally protect the host, but it doesn&#8217;t protect users or their online speech.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That article explains the level of nuance involved in handling complaints and the costs associated with protecting its users&#8217; freedom of speech. Automattic&#8217;s counsel concludes with an observation that &#8220;leaving such important decisions to the discretion of Internet hosts is misplaced and tilts the balance in favor of silencing often legitimate voices.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress.com is a Host for Websites, Not a Social Media Silo</h3>\n<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s platform is distinct from social networks in that it is not a social media silo. It acts more as a host and cannot have one-off shutdowns of sites anytime there is a public outcry.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress.com is much closer to being a common carrier than Facebook and other social media,&#8221; Dan Kennedy, associate professor at Northeastern University&#8217;s school of Journalism, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dankennedy_nu/status/1029343514243616769\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in response to the NYT article. &#8220;That difference really doesn’t get highlighted here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Self-hosted WordPress (.org) user and data journalist Matt Stiles also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stiles/status/1029220655013609472\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commented on the distinction</a>, and followed up with me privately, identifying WordPress.com as &#8220;a free-speech sidewalk for the Internet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress.com needs to make clear to the public that it&#8217;s a host, not a place that controls &#8212; through algorithms or other curation, and revenue — content,&#8221; Stiles said. &#8220;I am NOT a supporter of sites like this. I just want WordPress to thrive as an open-source tool and as an important paid host for web sites. I&#8217;m also worried about WordPress.com having to make arbitrary decisions about content. It&#8217;s tough to define hate speech. We know it when we see it, but I worry about censorship on private platforms.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dave Winer also <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/08/16/132055.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> that the article failed to capture the distinction of WordPress.com as a host for websites:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress.com isn&#8217;t like the others, it isn&#8217;t a silo, so banning him from that service will not necessarily have any affect on the presence of his site. He will be able to export his site, set up his own server, point the DNS entry at that server, and proceed on the open web and it will appear to outside viewers as if nothing happened. This will be the end of the discussion, unless the anti-speech advocates try to exert pressure on the open web. There they will find there is no CEO, no corporate headquarters, no shareholders afraid of losing value, none of the usual pressure points.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This particular situation regarding the Sandy Hook conspiracy site seems to have hit a nerve due to the fact that there are children involved. Despite WordPress.com&#8217;s quick privacy policy change in this instance, Automattic is still a rare outlier among publishing companies when it comes to support of free speech on the web. Media outlets and tech companies are increasingly clamoring for offensive content to be removed, instead of taking a principled stand against censorship.</p>\n<p>Today <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/news/200-newspapers-will-write-pro-journalism-editorials-will-they-also-listen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than 200 newspapers</a>, including the New York Times, are coordinating to publish editorials calling out President Trump&#8217;s characterization of the press as the &#8220;enemy of the people.&#8221; Corporate-owned news media is ready to decry attacks on free speech, but do they really believe in it when it counts? That freedom isn&#8217;t predicated on whether the speech is true or unoffensive to readers.</p>\n<p>Calling out a free speech platform like WordPress.com, without any distinction for its vital role in enabling journalists across the globe, is a coercive attempt to exact a desired result. What WordPress.com has done is groundbreaking in democratizing publishing and enabling bloggers to break news on their own sites.</p>\n<p>The New York Times raking WordPress.com over the coals for its refusal to censor its users is an egregious double standard. A publication cannot call for free speech for itself while eating up the rights of everyone else they don&#8217;t agree with. Principles aren&#8217;t principles if they only serve you when they are convenient.</p>\n<p>Forcing the censorship of offensive speech may feel like swift justice in the short term, but it weakens the fabric of a free society. Let discerning readers make up their own minds when they come across sites disseminating conspiracy theories.  Although it may be an unpopular stance, the tragic nature of this particular offense cannot bypass the principles that underpin our basic freedoms.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 16:58:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 327 – Truth, Misinformation, and Good Ideas\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=83205&preview=true&preview_id=83205\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-327-truth-misinformation-and-good-ideas\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2980:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss what&#8217;s new in the world of WordPress.

Jeet, <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/ill-keep-looking-for-a-cms-unless-i-find-wordpress/\">Saurabh</a>, <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-my-passport-to-open-source/\">Aditya</a>, <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/growing-wordpress-india/\">Alexander</a>, and <a href=\"https://heropress.com/?s=india\">many others</a> gave deep and meaningful advice on how I, as a white American male, should approach the task I had set before me. This is one of the reasons it makes me so happy when I hear stories of how WordPress changes lives there, especially for women.</p>\n<p>This week&#8217;s HeroPress replay is from Juhi Patel, from Gujarat, in northwestern India.

Not only did she have the courage to move against that belief system, WordPress gave her the tools to practically make it happen, and thereby be an example to other women around her.

This major update also revamps the classic editor&#8217;s meta box for those who do not have the Gutenberg plugin installed.</p>\n<p>In the past, the Yoast SEO meta box was displayed below the post editor. In the Gutenberg UI, the meta box has been redesigned to fit in the sidebar. Those testing Gutenberg will also temporarily find an additional meta box below the post, as the Yoast team has not yet added all optimizations to both yet. In the future, users will have the option to choose between the two.</p>\n<p>The updated design displays individual optimizations in collapsible panels with colored smiley face indicators for feedback at a glance. The snippet preview and social previews feature can still be found in the meta box below the post editor. They will be integrated more tightly into the Gutenberg UI in a future round of updates.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gutenberg-sidebar-yoast.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: <a href=\"https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-8-0-introducing-the-yoast-seo-gutenberg-sidebar-a-revamped-meta-box/\">Yoast SEO</a>\n<p>Yoast SEO 8.0 also brings some of the meta box UI improvements to the one displayed in the classic editor.

The Yoast SEO team is working on using modals to display previews for snippets and social posts from the sidebar so the interface isn&#8217;t split across two meta boxes. Users will eventually have the option to toggle either meta box display option into view, including those who are using the classic editor. The team is also working on allowing users to create blocks with the correct structured data automatically attached for things like books, recipes, products, and other specific content types.</p>\n<p>WordPress.org has a handful of popular SEO plugins and Yoast SEO is currently leading the pack when it comes to integration with the Gutenberg UI. In a recent support <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/gutenberg-12/#post-10379255\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thread</a>, All in One SEO Pack creator Michael Torbert said his plugin is &#8220;compatible with Gutenberg and will be getting new features to work with it in time.&#8221; Torbert doesn&#8217;t have full <a href=\"https://github.com/semperfiwebdesign/all-in-one-seo-pack/issues/1122\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg integration</a> assigned to a milestone on GitHub yet.</p>\n<p>The SEO Framework, another SEO plugin growing in popularity, appears to be in the same boat if <a href=\"https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/235\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub activity</a> is any indication.

In addition to the funding, selected companies will be able to take advantage of Awesome Motive&#8217;s media presence, network of business associates, and receive guidance.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The problem is that the WordPress market is not very well understood by investors,&#8221; Balkhi said. &#8220;And frankly, the majority of WordPress businesses are not large enough to meet their criteria.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;But this doesn’t mean that WordPress businesses don’t have the potential. It’s quite the opposite – they have a lot of potential. There are tons of opportunities to grow in the WordPress ecosystem with the right playbook, and I want to help prove that.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Founders will be given a lot of advice although they won&#8217;t be required to act upon it. Backers of the growth fund will also maintain a hands-off approach, interfering as little as possible with day-to-day operations. </p>\n\n<p>Five companies will be hand-selected to receive funding. To be eligible for investments, WordPress-focused companies must be at least six months old.

Keijonen&#8217;s WordPress.org-hosted themes are active on more than 10,000 websites.</p>\n<p>During the past three years he began taking on more client work, which gave him less time for theme building and maintenance. Last month he accepted a front-end engineer position at 10up that is keeping him busy.</p>\n<p>Fans might remember Keijonen&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-mina-olen-free-wordpress-theme-experiment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mina Olen Free WordPress Theme Experiment</a> when he made the theme available for free on GitHub to see if potential customers would be inspired to purchase after being able to test drive the theme on their own sites. At that time he said he struggled to support his theme shop, because the business aspect of it wasn&#8217;t one of his strengths.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to get lost in all the competition in the WordPress theme industry, especially when major players have more money to drop on advertising and support staff. The days of building a beautiful theme and selling it without any kind of marketing are long gone. Prospective theme developers have to be ready to embrace the challenges of competing in a much wider market in 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Foxland isn’t a gold mine,&#8221; Keijonen said in his announcement. &#8220;Foxland brings about 3,000 to 4,000 Euros per year, which is OK but my goal was 10,000 euros.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Customers appreciated Keijonen&#8217;s attention to detail, accessibility, and performance. Respected WordPress theme author <a href=\"https://tungdo.github.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tung Do</a> said Keijonen&#8217;s themes are &#8220;great examples of best practices.&#8221; Many of them also include support for popular plugins.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/downloads/checathlon/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Checathlon</a>, one of his best works, is active on <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foxland.fi</a>.

All of Keijonen&#8217;s custom <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/downloads/category/plugins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plugins</a> (created to accompany the themes) are also available for free.</p>\n<p>The Foxland shop has cancelled all the recurring subscriptions but will continue to support existing purchases up to a year from the purchase date. Keijonen said he will maintain most of the old themes and plugins with small updates coming in the future but plans to deprecate some as well.</p>\n<p>The landscape of WordPress theming is about to change quite a bit when Gutenberg is merged into core.

The service is now widely used by many open source projects. Webpack, one of the first major Open Collective success stories, was able to fund its first full-time developer through the service and is now <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/webpack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">operating on an estimated annual budget of $331,471</a>. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/how-the-san-francisco-wordpress-meetup-is-using-open-collective-to-fund-activities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco WordPress meetup</a> (WPSFO) is one example of a WordPress group that successfully uses the service to <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/wordpress-sf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">receive sponsorships</a> that help cover expenses for events.</p>\n<p>Open Collective has launched a new tool called <a href=\"https://backyourstack.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BackYourStack</a> that helps people and organizations become aware of projects they use that need funding. The tool scans GitHub accounts (for individuals and organizations) and identifies projects that have already set up accounts on Open Collective. The tool shows all detected dependencies and the repositories where they are used.</p>\n<p>Here are a few sample results you get from scanning the WordPress GitHub account:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-13-at-11.36.42-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The results display where project is used, the number of full-time maintainers, progress to reach the next goal, and a few organizations that are already backing the project. Open Collective also allows backers to support multiple dependences in bulk via a lump sum as an alternative to backing each project individually.</p>\n<p>Not every open source project listed on Open Collective will have the need to fund salaries and events, but even a small yearly budget can reduce out-of-pocket costs for open source maintainers for things like hosting and promotional costs.

Yoast SEO 8.0 is coming next week with the first round of compatibility in place.</p>\n<p>&#8220;8.0 is coming on Tuesday with most of it, some bits are relying on the integration of an annotations API in Gutenberg, which is not entirely under our control,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;We need that to do markings like we do in the classic editor to highlight where your errors are. Feature complete is quite a while off &#8211; we want to do a LOT. Gutenberg is opening a whole new playing field for us in terms of more in context, actionable feedback.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Future versions of Yoast SEO will offer more features inline, instead of housing them in a single meta box.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We started by breaking down all our features, and seeing where we could integrate them into Gutenberg,&#8221; de Valk said in a <a href=\"https://yoast.com/gutenberg-integration/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> outlining Yoast SEO&#8217;s planned approach back in October 2017. &#8220;We don’t think holding on to a single, massive box below the editor will best serve our customers. We’d much rather integrate right where the action happens, and Gutenberg offers us that chance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For example, readability analysis can be shown on a per-block basis to provide more fine-grained feedback:</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/readability-analysis.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: <a href=\"https://yoast.com/gutenberg-integration/\">Yoast SEO</a>\n<p>&#8220;You’ll get actionable feedback in context,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;You don’t have to scroll down to a meta box to see the advice and scroll up again to the place where you should implement it. If we give feedback per block, you will get a better understanding of all the factors that influence SEO.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Yoast SEO team has been enthusiastic about what the Gutenberg era will bring to WordPress. In a recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdevalk/status/1026084237508788225\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter thread</a>, de Valk summarized his thoughts on the project and described the direction the Yoast SEO plugin is headed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[I&#8217;ve] been thinking about Gutenberg more lately, as discussion about it is growing now that it&#8217;s near to WordPress core inclusion. What is most important in what we&#8217;re doing is something I think most people don&#8217;t see yet: The new &#8216;blocks&#8217; that Gutenberg introduces allow us to, much more easily, make content items instead of web pages the smallest particle of the web.</p>\n<p>Questions and answers, how to&#8217;s, recipes, suddenly all of them can much more easily have metadata, and be reused. This is particularly important to SEOs: the search engines, driven by voice search requirements, are searching for answers, more than for &#8216;just&#8217; URLs to send traffic to, and blocks allow us to give them those answers, in a format both they and users can understand. While doing this, it allows us to keep the separation of content and design, something we definitely need to think more about.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With Gutenberg compatibility on its way from widely-used plugins like ACF and Yoast SEO, users can have confidence more plugins they depend on will follow suit. These major players are the first cracks in the ice across the ecosystem that will soon make Gutenberg-support the standard for any product that wants to compete.</p>\n<p>de Valk encouraged users to look at the advent of Gutenberg as a door to new opportunities during this transition time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg is not &#8216;done,\'&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s ready to ship, but I also think it opens up a world of new opportunities and discussions. It&#8217;s not all &#8216;right&#8217; yet either, so there will have to be changes as more people use it and get used to it. I do realize this is a drastic change in some ways. But it&#8217;s also not half as bad as people think it is. I have seen people use it for the first time, most people get used to it very quickly. Last but not least: you don&#8217;t have to switch now. The classic editor plugin exists for a reason. You can put off your switch for a year, or even two. But eventually I think everyone will see the power of the new editor and will switch.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 09 Aug 2018 21:54:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WPTavern: Advanced Custom Fields to Add Gutenberg Compatibility in Version 5.0, Slated for September\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83016\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://wptavern.com/advanced-custom-fields-to-add-gutenberg-compatibility-in-version-5-0-slated-for-september\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4880:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-08-at-10.50.38-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced Custom Fields</a> (ACF) team published an <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/the-state-of-acf-in-a-gutenberg-world/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> today, assuring users that Gutenberg compatibility is in the works and will be available in version 5.0 of the free version in September 2018. The plugin, created by Elliot Condon, makes it easy for developers to add custom fields to WordPress edit screens, including posts, users, taxonomy terms, and media.</p>\n<p>ACF is widely used with more than a million active installations. Developers have been concerned about whether or not their custom fields would continue to work on their clients&#8217; websites after the new editor makes its debut in WordPress 5.0.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg treats legacy metaboxes as second class citizens in the interface, stuffed at the bottom of the new edit screen. Metaboxes should, however, continue to work as expected. The ACF announcement lets developers know what to expect for how their metaboxes will appear inside Gutenberg:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By default, our beloved metaboxes are pushed all the way to the bottom of the screen in an awkward attempt to retain compatibility. This placement feels very much like an afterthought from the Gutenberg developers and creates a disjointed editing experience for those of us (1+ million awesome ACF users) who extend the edit screens with extra fields.</p>\n<p>While this setup isn’t ideal, we will continue to work within the system to ensure that ACF is integrated into the Gutenberg UI to the fullest extent possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The free version of ACF will introduce Gutenberg compatibility in its version 5 release, which is slated for early September 2018. The compatibility update will only apply to version 5 and later, so the ACF team urges developers to running 4.x to upgrade to 5 as soon as it becomes available. Developers can also elect to upgrade early by turning on ACF&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/upgrade-guide-version-5/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Early Access</a> feature.</p>\n<p>The most surprising news is that ACF is introducing its own &#8220;ACF Blocks,&#8221; an <code>acf_register_block()</code> function that allows developers to register their own custom blocks without having to learn JavaScript.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the big selling points of Gutenberg is the ability for developers to create custom blocks.

Without the right tools, it can be overwhelming to simply get started building even the most basic theme.</p><cite>Justin Tadlock</cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>While starter themes are nothing new in the WordPress space, Mythic and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-rig-a-wordpress-starter-theme-and-build-process-in-one\">WP Rig</a> take things to the next level and relatively share the same goal of providing a modern foundation to develop on top of. </p>\n\n<p>Part of the inspiration to build Mythic began two years ago. In trying to revamp the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/news/\">News theme</a>, Tadlock became frustrated with how difficult it was to use old coding methods and dropped the project.<br />><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&#8220;In a lot of ways, it was the catalyst that started me down this road toward Mythic,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize it at the time. But, that&#8217;s where some of my frustration began with modern theme building.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Mythic supports PHP 5.6+ although Tadlock is strongly pushing developers towards PHP 7+. &#8220;Anything earlier than 5.6 means for clunky code that’s just a headache to maintain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;WordPress, as a community, needs to be pushing people to update.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Support for SASS, LESS, CSS, and Stylus are built-in and developers can choose which language they prefer for builds. ES6+ was chosen for JavaScript and is commonly used for building Gutenberg blocks. </p>\n\n<p>Mythic comes with <a href=\"http://getbem.com/\">BEM</a> or Block-Element-Modifier. BEM is a methodology that enables developers to create reusable elements and sharing code in front-end environments. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;BEM is a popular solution because it goes hand-in-hand with modern CSS pre-processors,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;It also allows you to keep your styles flat and not get lost in <em>specificity hell</em>. This means smaller, faster stylesheets that are easier to override when you, a child theme author, or user need to do something custom.&#8221; The starter theme uses <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\">Webpack</a> in combination with <a href=\"https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix\">Laravel Mix</a> to manage assets and modules.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Mythic has an <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/weblog/working-with-the-view-class\">extended View class</a> that allows theme authors to use their preferred folder structure. Theme authors can also add custom data to theme templates. According to Tadlock, both features are not part of WordPress&#8217; native templating system. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to Mythic, Tadlock has continued to work on the <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/hybrid-core\">Hybrid Core </a>framework. Hybrid Core is a required dependency that is added via Composer. </p>\n\n<p>Using Mythic with Hybrid Core exposes developers to features of the framework that they otherwise may not discover. &#8220;I rewrote nearly all of HC5 from scratch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a result, it’s leaner, more organized, and more cohesive.&#8221; The starter theme is also Gutenberg-ready.<br /></p>\n\n<h2>Tadlock Experiments with Sponsorship Pricing Model<br /></h2>\n\n<p>Mythic is in open beta and available for free via <a href=\"https://github.com/justintadlock/mythic\">GitHub</a>. The <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/themes/mythic\">pricing model</a> is an honor system experiment. Tadlock is asking those who build projects for clients and generating a profit, to make a $99 sponsorship purchase. For commercially-sold themes, he is asking for $199. Both packages come with one year of support and access to the company&#8217;s Slack channel. <br /></p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still taking feedback on the payment system,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;It could change. There have been a few suggestions more of a lifetime/flat fee. I&#8217;d prefer to just get some generous sponsors and keep it all $free. We&#8217;ll see where that goes in this next month of the beta process.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Mythic&#8217;s beta ends on September 3rd in which he&#8217;ll release version 1.0. Until then, he is trying to get as much feedback as possible from developers.

This new module ports WordPress&#8217; Gutenberg editor over to Drupal. It was created by Per André Rønsen and his team <a href=\"https://www.frontkom.no/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Frontkom</a>, a digital services agency based in Norway.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://drupalgutenberg.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal Gutenberg</a> project aims to provide a new publishing experience based on WordPress&#8217; Gutenberg editor. The <a href=\"https://drupalgutenberg.org/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> on the site currently provides a frontend interactive implementation of Gutenberg inside Drupal, similar to WordPress&#8217; &#8220;Frontenberg&#8221; demo on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wordpress.org/gutenberg</a>. The latest implementation of the module will appear there but Rønsen said it is currently being revamped, as lots of things have happened with Gutenberg in the past few weeks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drupal-gutenberg.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>How the Drupal Gutenberg Project was Born</h3>\n<p>Rønsen told us he first saw Gutenberg in 2017 and was inspired to use it for one of Frontkom&#8217;s media clients.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The thought of forking it came mid-2017, as we explored using Gutenberg as a lib for making a front page builder sponsored by the Google Digital News Initiative,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;We ended up using it, and the Drupal module is a natural spin off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Frontkom tailored the Gutenberg-based page builder for the media industry. It adds extra functionality to Gutenberg that allows users to position and tweak articles for the front page of an online newspaper. Rønsen said the project went well and his team plans to open source it but it&#8217;s too early to share anything right now.</p>\n<p>Following this successful experience using Gutenberg for a client, Frontkom began work on the Drupal Gutenberg project in early January 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main part of the work was to make Gutenberg more CMS agnostic,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;First we forked it and maintained a fork. Later we started using Gutenberg as a dependency, testing a more maintainable approach.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rønsen opened a ticket on GitHub, requesting that the Gutenberg team consider <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2780\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">structuring the project to be more CMS-agnostic</a>. The ticket was closed fairly soon with the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2780#issuecomment-342569414\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">explanation</a> that it &#8220;doesn&#8217;t relate directly to the work going on with the project and its goals.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have very little, if any, upstream commits so far, as the WP core interest has been to just cater to WP needs so far,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;But that just changed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg is moving towards making it easier to use outside of WordPress. The team is working on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3955\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">publishing all the React modules as npm packages</a>. Rønsen said he anticipates that decreasing the number of globals needed to make Gutenberg work will be a huge help for other CMSs.</p>\n<p>So far the Drupal Gutenberg project has not been shared widely but Rønsen said his team has seen a lot of interest from the Drupal tech community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a blog post coming in English with more detail; we kind of saved it for after holidays,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;But then it blew up, and devs keep contacting us wanting to help out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Frontkom has been involved in the Drupal community for more than 10 years and WordPress for the past three years. Rønsen and his team believe that Gutenberg fills a gap in the Drupal space.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Drupal doesn&#8217;t have all those fancy WordPress page builders,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So that is really more interesting than just a new post edit UI – we want a unified way to build complex layouts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Drupal already has an initiative for revamping its admin UI using React, and Rønsen said he thinks Gutenberg might contribute to how this can happen in Drupal core. In an ideal world, many open source projects could greatly benefit from a CMS-agnostic Gutenberg, with all of them contributing together towards its improvement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To us as a company, it is extremely interesting to build out front-ends that can easily be moved between CMSs,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;For open source CMSs in general, I think there will be a lot to learn from the implementation process. For example, D8 has the concept of &#8216;everything is a block.&#8217; This has made it easy for us to make Drupal core blocks available in Gutenberg – we just need to do some magic to expose block settings.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Frontkom team are not only enthusiastic fans of Gutenberg&#8217;s interface, but also appreciate the way the project is run. Rønsen hasn&#8217;t been following the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-plugin-garners-mixed-reactions-from-new-wave-of-testers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community reaction to the latest round of Gutenberg testing</a> but said he thinks WordPress users will love it long term, since &#8220;most of the page builders out there have issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Drupal can learn a lot from WordPress, the way they actually built the Gutenberg project – a transparent design process, lots of collaboration, and still highly efficient,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;So, WordPress is definitely ahead of Drupal with regards to their admin UI/JS work. Since there is already a lot of interest in the Drupal community to do something similar, it is very refreshing to see someone go through it and succeed (hopefully).&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevector\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Persch</a>, lead developer advocate at Pantheon, spoke at DrupalCon in Nashville 2018 about <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/whats-possible-wordpress-50\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">what&#8217;s possible with WordPress 5.0</a> and also gave a session at Twin Cities Drupal Camp titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://2018.tcdrupal.org/session/everything-block-how-wordpress-rewrote-wysiwyg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Everything is a Block: How WordPress Rewrote the WYSIWYG</a>.&#8221; In response to buzz on Twitter about the Drupal Gutenberg session, Persch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevector/status/1026461967630983169\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> Drupal needs an editorial UX improvement to stay competitive, but not necessarily by adopting Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have in-progress initiatives toward that end,&#8221; Persch said. &#8220;Gutenberg itself could turn into a distraction from that work. In both [presentations] I also mentioned that Paragraphs or Layout Builder could be better data model starting points for Gutenberg-like functionality. Delivering exactly the same thing as WordPress would be self-defeating. Structured content is the heart of Drupal. I see Gutenberg (or something like it) as a better UI for the corner of the data model (the Paragraphs part) that Drupal sites have had for years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how different open source communities approach Gutenberg and how more diverse feedback from outside of WordPress could impact the project.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/marcofernandes/2981601\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal Gutenberg module</a> can be downloaded from the project page.

The goal of the prompt is to get more users testing the new editor and to raise awareness. Within the first 72 hours of the prompt going into user dashboards, sites with Gutenberg installed have shot up to more than 80,000, a 300% increase. The plugin has been downloaded more than 147,000 times in the past week.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg feedback is pouring in from a wave of new testers, most of whom are finding out about the new editor for the first time. Reactions have varied widely across multiple social networks. The announcement on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WordPress/posts/10156301634992911\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress&#8217; official Facebook account</a> attracted many drive-by style comments that included negative reactions, confusion, and questions, with a few positive comments peppered in between.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Blocks aren’t doing it for me.

Gutenberg reviews are currently at a 2.4-star average, slipping from the 2.7-star average it held prior to the 4.9.8 release.

However, there are many reasons why a tester might be motivated to write a negative review. Some may have ignored the advice not to use it in production, some may be testing it with incompatible plugins, some may not want any changes to their established workflow, and some may simply not like the interface.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-05-at-10.24.03-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>While it may seem that the plugin has been widely panned by new testers, those who are the most critical tend to be more motivated to write a review.

The invitation has already succeeded at pulling out some quality feedback if you can sort through all the casual, angry one-liners.</p>\n<p>Steven Peters opened a lengthy <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/in-one-word-no-please-read-full-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">review</a> with the following observations about the more cumbersome and unintuitive aspects of Gutenberg&#8217;s interface:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The interface is not cohesive in its design. For example, To place a block of a paragraph, a heading, a subheading, a bullet list and every other block, the user must click the + sign every single time, making it that much harder to ‘go with the flow’ of writing, and is cumbersome and time-consuming. Time-consuming: a click for each block instead of just writing. More clicks equal wasted time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a review titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/lots-of-potential-but-too-soon-for-core/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lots of potential but too soon for core</a>,&#8221; Mark Wilkinson details several specific usability issues:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The interface I find confusing – I think it is because it is too minimal. I found that it was all too easy to add a block by mistake and then not knowing what the block was or why it was there.</p>\n<p>There is too much reliance on hover effects, with things appearing and disappearing all the time. I also find it hard to know where the focus is on the screen as it just uses a faint grey border.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Several reviewers were candid about their distaste for the concept of putting content into blocks. The Gutenberg team has readily communicated its vision for the block-based editor, but this tends to speak more to developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why does every little thing have to be in a separate block?&#8221; one reviewer <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/im-not-change-resistant-but-this-has-a-way-to-go/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a> before describing multiple usability issues with current block behavior. &#8220;That is a feature I think I actually detest. I do not want 50 zillion little fussy blocks on a page. I had entire blocks just disappear on me and a lot of the time, I was initially unsure of exactly what I did to make them disappear. This is bad. Some of the time it was placing a block, like an image block, and then deleting the image … the entire block went, which meant I had to go through the motions to add the block, then add an image block again, and then add my image again. Lame.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Multiple reviewers commented that previously simple tasks are much more complicated in Gutenberg. Others said after reading official replies to reviews, they felt that leaving specific feedback was a waste of time. Canned responses from the Gutenberg team gave some the impression that their feedback wasn&#8217;t heard or valued.</p>\n<blockquote><p>My feeling while reading the WordPress developer responses is that that they have no intention of either stopping or postponing Gutenberg no matter what bug or problem is given to their attention. &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/can-i-just-interject-here/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@lauritasita</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I have read all the reviews (and also the Gutenberg-lovers’ replies) and it seems that it is not really a discussion. The question on what is missing in this editor is useless if people simply do not want such a feature in their install. All you do is trying to convince people that it would only take time to get used to a modern technology. In my eyes this is bullshit. I myself love new features – if they are useful. &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/time-to-respect-your-users-matt/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@peg20</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Based on the responses to reviews, it isn&#8217;t clear to testers whether the Gutenberg team is willing to make major changes to re-design features that are not easy to use or whether they are simply combing the reviews for feedback on bugs with the existing interface.</p>\n<h3>Classic Editor Plugin Installations are on the Rise as Users Prepare for WordPress 5.0</h3>\n<p>In the days following WordPress 4.9.8&#8217;s release, active installations of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> plugin have jumped from 7,000 to 60,000, a 757% increase.

When WordPress 5.0 lands, neither way should be seen as the &#8216;correct&#8217; way &#8211; they&#8217;re both entirely legitimate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One major theme in both positive and negative reviews of the plugin is the desire for Gutenberg to be opt-in for WordPress 5.0, instead of having it auto-enabled for all users.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The \"Try Gutenberg\" callout in WordPress 4.9.8 looks great!

For millions of other WordPress users without their own developers or engineering teams, discovering Gutenberg auto-enabled after updating to WordPress 5.0 will be a moment of reckoning.

Hundreds of high quality free stock photo sites have cropped up on the web over the past few years, but Pexels is differentiating itself with a commitment to hosting diversity-focused images and videos that represent a wide range of experiences. WordPress.com is working with them and other partners to <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/read/feeds/25823/posts/1945569908\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">make more diverse images available to users</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Stock-image libraries have historically struggled to represent all experiences, and often excluded photos of people of color, people with disabilities, or non-binary individuals. Pexels is working to change that, and since partnering with them we’ve helped incorporate diversity-focused libraries to their collection. Ultimately, we believe it’s on us to help find a solution to this problem, and avoid generic stock images that often perpetuate stereotypes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress.com users can access the images via the Add Media button. Self-hosted site owners with Jetpack-enabled sites can also access the library when composing new posts on WordPress.com. Automattic happiness engineer Anne McCarthy posted a demo of where to find the new images:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/c-ZzCzFS1Rn\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cldup.com/mJOr5iicyD.gif?resize=627%2C348&ssl=1\" alt=\"Media\" width=\"627\" height=\"348\" /></a></p>\n<p>More than 1,000 developers and companies are using the <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/api/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pexels API</a>. The site regularly hosts diversity-focused photo <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/challenges/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">challenges</a> with prizes for the best submissions. Photographers who are inspired to contribute can submit their work to the library but should be aware of its <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo-license\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">open license</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I like the idea, and, as a photoblogger, I’m open to sharing my images,&#8221; one reader commented on the announcement. &#8220;But I [think] the license rules are too open (for me).

The prices for each pass were as follows:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Personal Pass: $199</li><li>Extended Pass: $399</li><li>Professional Pass: $699</li><li>All Access Pass: $899</li></ul>\n\n<p>After six weeks, Williamson noticed that customers were continuing to purchase individual extensions instead of the passes. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Our expectation and intent in creating the passes was for store owners to be able to purchase access to multiple individual extensions in a more economical way, but that’s not what happened,&#8221; he said. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Instead, store owners continued to purchase only the individual extensions they needed because the price tags of the passes were still too high. It is clear that we made a mistake in our pass pricing, and so today we’d like to apologize for that and announce new, lower prices.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>After two weeks of testing, the prices of each pass have been significantly reduced to the following amounts:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Personal Pass: <strong>$99</strong></li><li>Extended Pass: <strong>$199</strong></li><li>Professional Pass: <strong>$299</strong></li><li>All Access Pass: <strong>$499</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></li></ul>\n\n<p>In addition to the pricing changes, customers who purchased a pass between June 1st and August 1st are eligible for a refund. The refund is equal to the difference of the purchased price and the new price. Customers have until August 15th, to <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/support\">request a refund</a>. <br /></p>\n\n<p>Customers who purchased passes before the reduction will have their renewal amounts automatically changed to the lower price. </p>\n\n<p>Pricing WordPress products and services is tough and requires experimentation. There are numerous <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=pricing\">WordCamp sessions</a>, <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-price-a-product-wordpress/\">articles</a>, and <a href=\"https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/pricing-your-wordpress-services/\">in-depth guides</a> on the subject but there&#8217;s not one answer that&#8217;s best for every business. </p>\n\n<p>Publicly admitting to a pricing mistake is one thing, but offering refunds to try to get customers on equal footing is going the extra mile.</p>\n\n<p>The company could have handled things in a way that&#8217;s not as beneficial to customers, but they chose what I think is a commendable way. Williamson&#8217;s closing statement speaks about the way he leads his company and how he makes these types of decisions.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>While we are far from perfect, as this pricing mistake clearly indicates, we are dedicated to doing right by our customers. To each of you, we would like to extend our most sincere thanks for sticking with us as we work through these changes</p><cite>Pippin Williamson</cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a luxury to have business owners like Williamson in the WordPress economy. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 Aug 2018 01:00:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 3.4 Adds New Warning to Classic Editor When Editing Posts Containing Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82772\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-3-4-adds-new-warning-to-classic-editor-when-editing-posts-containing-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2614:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/07/31/whats-new-in-gutenberg-30th-july/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 3.4</a> was released yesterday with fixes intended to prepare the plugin for converting existing content to blocks.

Because of that strange sense of time and action I’ve always been quite fond of the quote from Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland</p>\n<p>“Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.”<br />\nBut where, for this story, is the beginning?</p>\n<p>It was a lifetime of choices and serendipitous encounters that led me down the path to WordPress and eventually Automattic. And those same types of choices and encounters that keep me here.</p>\n<h2>Begin at the Beginning&#8230;</h2>\n<p>I was a youngish mother of a youngish child and a full time stay at home parent. I didn’t work outside the home; I was raising my kid. That was both a privilege and a problem. I realized that, as a mother consumed with caring for this new human, I was beginning to lose the very strong sense of identity that I’d always had.</p>\n<p>This was my first experience with not knowing who I was. I always knew who I was, even if I didn’t know who I wanted to be. As a mother though, most of who I am was sucked into caring for my family. Not sleeping. Not taking proper care of myself. Not taking time for my interests. Putting the others in my house before me and saying that it was what I wanted.</p>\n<p><em>Narrator: It wasn’t.</em></p>\n<p>There was a pivot point. A moment before my daughter turned three. When I realized that if she were to choose to become a mother I would not want her to go down the same path of self denial that I had. I would want her to be who she is first and a mother second so that she could be the best self and mother she could be.</p>\n<p>And I realized that was something I could only show by example. But how to start? I’d always been a writer. I often say that I only learned to read so that I could write. Journaling, short stories, poetry. Sometimes just long strings of thoughts and observations that wouldn’t leave my head until I wrote them down. I would write out long “stories” on MySpace about my experiences and realizations. I would scrawl poetry on scrap paper laying around the house. None of it was enough.</p>\n<p>Also, as I understand is fairly typical for a stay at home parent, I had no one to talk to most of the time except for my small child. And while she was super awesome and receptive to any conversation I may want to start, they all tended to transition to discussion of My Little Ponies or a request for ice cream or screen time. So I looked for something more. For a place to discuss the mommified version of myself with no one and everyone. I started a blog.</p>\n<p>But it wasn’t on WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Go On…</h2>\n<p>I wrote and I wrote and I wrote. My experiences, my kid’s experiences. Dreams and hopes and bad poetry. And I found a group of people who shared with me their struggles and dreams as they dove into mine. A web of women and men who got me. Who got what I was going through. Who got what I was doing. A community of individuals, not all like minded, but all understanding.</p>\n<p>And then one day I was asked to write for a city blog, and then another. And as my writing began to expand I found other communities. My sense of self was first preserved but then invigorated and it grew and I stretched my arms and I stretched my wings and I realized I was beginning to feel whole for the first time in a long while.</p>\n<p>But using multiple platforms for my blogging gave me the understanding that the platform I was using was restrictive and unsatisfying. Clunky.</p>\n<p>And that’s when a friend mentioned WordCamp Portland. It was this new thing. We were doing it for the first time. A bunch of bloggers getting together to talk about WordPress and blogging and stuff.</p>\n<p>I had no idea what WordPress was. But my friend said they needed some volunteers to help out, and I’m always one to support my friends, my community. So I asked what I needed to do to help.</p>\n<p>“Move your blog to WordPress”</p>\n<p>And so I did. And something clicked. Once I had moved to a WordPress site I found my passion for blogging was something more. I played with themes, I made headers that felt like art pieces, I helped others transfer their content, set up their sites. I introduced them to a community that I was just beginning to get to know.</p>\n<p>And then there was a cascade of activity. More blogs, podcasting, events, community, and every year there was WordCamp Portland. And I continued to learn and grow my skills as a writer, as a blogger, as a podcaster, and as a WordPresser. I continued to volunteer, and then to speak, and to help organize.</p>\n<h2>And on…</h2>\n<p>But life changes. Sometimes for the better sometimes for the worse. But change is hard. People change or stay the same. Relationships change. Life changes. Sometimes all of the above. So I ended a marriage and found myself stumped. I knew who I was, but who I happened to be was a stay at home mom who hadn’t worked outside the home in eight years and had no marketable skills that I could find that would also allow me to continue to be home for my kid.</p>\n<p>And I panicked and I procrastinated and then I found an opening. A small startup I knew through my interactions with the community needed a customer support person who also knew WordPress.</p>\n<p>A light went on. And I had a job for the first time in eight years. And I knew what I was doing. And I was good at it. And I continued to blog. A little. And I stuck to the little tiny fringes of the WordPress community I knew. Still not realizing how big the rest of it was.</p>\n<p>The Portland WordPress folks were like a river feeding into the ocean of the worldwide community. But I’d only ever stood on the shores of the river and dipped my toes in. All that was about to change.</p>\n<h2>Till You Come to the End…</h2>\n<p>But as I said at the beginning, it’s not that simple. There is no end. There is just more. More stories, more people, more learning, more community. And that’s where we begin the part of the story that tells us where I am today.</p>\n<p>This part begins with an email from a community friend with a link to a job posting. And a new beginning.</p>\n<p>I was working happily at that small startup, spreading my wings. But starting to feel a little bit like my passion wasn’t being put to use when that email arrived. A link to a job posting working as a sponsored volunteer within the WordPress community and question. It was a simple question. “Do you know anyone who would kick ass at this job?”</p>\n<p>DID I? I was reeling from the possibility and doubled over with imposter syndrome and fear. Fear that I wasn’t good enough. Fear that they wouldn’t like me. Fear that I’d be leaving my boss in the lurch.</p>\n<p>So I did what I always did at that time. And what I still do to this day. I procrastinated. I talked. I thought. I woke up in the middle of the night in a panic thinking I had forgotten something. Thinking I had done something wrong.</p>\n<p>But as I sat there one day tinkering on the startup’s site, scheduling posts, checking in on our customers all while getting my daughter ready for school that morning I realized that it was time to set aside those fears. To look that imposter syndrome right in the eye and say “not today” and I started putting together my resume and working on the cover email.</p>\n<p>No one was more surprised than I when I found myself two months later starting my first day at Automattic.</p>\n<p>It’s been about 5 and a half years since that email landed in my inbox. It’s been more than a decade since WordPress landed in my heart and I’m proud to make my living in the wide wonderful world of WordPress. As I write this story for all of you to read—not a cautionary tale I hope, but an inspirational one—I’m just a few days away from the end of my three-month sabbatical (a benefit that all Automatticians are eligible for after 5 years.)</p>\n<p>It’s been a time of rest, readjustment, relaxation. Of edification. But it’s also been a renewal. A time to look back at how I got where I am and remember how lucky I am to be here today. And I owe it all to a little bit of gumption and to the amazing community of WordPressers who opened their world to me. And also to everyone else who is willing to be a part of this great big community founded on open source. On WordPress.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Begin at the Beginning\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Begin%20at%20the%20Beginning&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbegin-at-the-beginning%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Begin at the Beginning\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbegin-at-the-beginning%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbegin-at-the-beginning%2F&title=Begin+at+the+Beginning\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Begin at the Beginning\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/begin-at-the-beginning/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/080118-150x150.jpg&description=Begin at the Beginning\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Begin at the Beginning\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/begin-at-the-beginning/\" title=\"Begin at the Beginning\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/begin-at-the-beginning/\">Begin at the Beginning</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 01 Aug 2018 08:00:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Cami Kaos\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.9.8 RC 3 Released, Limits ‘Try Gutenberg’ Callout Visibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82803\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-8-rc-3-released-limits-try-gutenberg-callout-visibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1701:\"<p>WordPress 4.9.8 Release Candidate 3 <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/07/31/wordpress-4-9-8-release-candidate-3/\">is available</a> for testing.

In April, the platform <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/04/24/new-facebook-platform-product-changes-policy-updates/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> sweeping changes to the publish_actions permission, which allowed apps to publish to users&#8217; timeline on their behalf.</p>\n<blockquote><p>On August 1st, 2018, the Live API publish_actions permission, which allows an app to publish on behalf of its Users, will be reserved for approved partners. A new permission model that allows apps to publish Videos to their User&#8217;s Groups and Timeline will be created instead.</p>\n<p>Access to the Pages APIs requires re-submission of the application for review before August 1, 2018. This will be required to continue publishing live and VOD video to Pages, as well as reading insights.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Facebook is notorious for swiftly changing its APIs in ways that break apps (sometimes without warning), often sending developers scrambling. For a long time, apps auto-posting to user timelines was part of the wild west of app permissions granted without much oversight from Facebook. Users often unknowingly gave permission to apps that would collect data and spam their Facebook connections with posts made on their behalf.</p>\n<p>Those days are over, but an unfortunate byproduct of this restriction is that apps like WordPress.com and Jetpack&#8217;s Publicize feature can no longer automatically publish posts to user timelines. This change also adversely affects apps like Buffer and Hootsuite that allow users to schedule and publish posts to their social accounts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2018/07/30/jetpack-6-3-3-facebook-publicize/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack 6.3.3</a> removes the ability for users to select Facebook Profile connections and displays a notice regarding existing connections, so users will be aware of which auto-posting connections they are losing. Besides Jetpack, this Facebook API change affects tens of thousands of users who have this functionality implemented through one of many other plugins on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>Users are now required to manually share their posts to their timelines. They can no longer schedule content to be shared to Facebook at specific times for different audiences.</p>\n<p>Auto-posting to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/175644189234902/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook Pages</a> still works, and one option users have is to convert their Profile to a Page or set up a new page. This may not be a suitable alternative for bloggers and those whose writing is not attached to a business or an organization.</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2018/07/my-recode-decode-interview-with-kara-swisher/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on his blog, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg commented on Facebook&#8217;s decision to turn off auto-posting to profiles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As it turns out, Facebook also is turning off the ability for WordPress sites — and all websites — to post directly to users’ profile pages,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;The decision to shut down the API is ostensibly to fight propaganda and misinformation on the platform, but I think it’s a big step back for their embrace of the open web. I hope they change their minds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If only a select few &#8220;approved partners&#8221; are allowed to automatically broadcast to user timelines, it puts smaller players at a disadvantage, requiring manual sharing each time they publish. Facebook is setting itself up as a gatekeeper that enables news from a small selection of partners to keep pumping through the platform on schedule. Individual voices on smaller websites are no longer able to syndicate to the Facebook platform unless they decide to create a Page.</p>\n<p>Put a different way, the only syndicated content allowed on Facebook will be through channels the company can monetize &#8211; business/organization Pages or partners who are approved to post to user timelines. Users who care about retaining their Facebook audiences will need to remember to manually post their content to the social network after August 1, 2018, when the API changes go into effect.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 22:11:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"Matt: My Recode Decode Interview with Kara Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48262\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://ma.tt/2018/07/my-recode-decode-interview-with-kara-swisher/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1780:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;We want to make the best tools in the world, and we want to do it for decades to come.

He encouraged attendees at his session to venture outside of WordCamps and said he hopes to see more collaboration across the platforms in the future.

The Gutenberg handbook has an <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/extensibility/theme-support/\">excellent article</a> on how to opt-in and add support for enhanced features.</p>\n\n<p>Most themes will present the default blocks without any issues as the blocks themselves provide their own styles. If you use a theme that does not fully support Gutenberg such as the Wide or Full Block Alignment options, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-support-for-gutenberg/\">Theme Support for Gutenberg</a> plugin may be for you. </p>\n\n<p>Created by <a href=\"https://weavertheme.com/about/\">Weweaver</a>, Theme Support for Gutenberg claims to allow most WordPress themes to be compatible with Gutenberg. In addition to theme support, the plugin adds a Classic Editor button to the admin bar to easily switch between Gutenberg and the Classic Editor.</p>\n\n<p>Since a default WordPress theme is used to show how this plugin is beneficial, I decided to try it for myself. I installed the plugin on a fresh install of WordPress 4.9.7, Gutenberg 3.3, and the latest version of Twenty Sixteen. I published a Gutenberg Demo post which uses many of the default blocks.<br /></p>\n\n<h2>Twenty Sixteen Looks Better Without It<br /></h2>\n\n<p>Here is what the Gallery block looks like in Twenty Sixteen with the plugin disabled. The content looks good and fits within the content column.</p>\n\n<img />Theme Support for Gutenberg Disabled\n\n<p>When the plugin is enabled, the images are so large, a horizontal scroll bar appears. </p>\n\n<img />Theme Support for Gutenberg Enabled\n\n<p>The plugin includes additional styling for default blocks. One block that doesn&#8217;t benefit from the enhanced styles is the Video block. With the plugin disabled, the video block appears normally. </p>\n\n<img />Video Block With The Plugin Disabled<br />\n\n<p>With the plugin enabled, the video block overflows the content column and breaches into the left sidebar.</p>\n\n<img />Video Block With The Plugin Enabled \n\n<p>Although the plugin initially shipped with no options, version 0.2 includes new settings that provide better compatibility for some themes. I checked the box to disable Fitvids support which solved the video block issue. However, the other options had no effect on the oversized image blocks. <br /></p>\n\n<img />Theme Support Options\n\n<p>Twenty Sixteen and Twenty Seventeen do not work well with this plugin. There may be themes, particularly older ones that benefit, but more modern themes will likely be ok without it. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 22:42:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: WooSesh Virtual WooCommerce Conference to be Held October 18-19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82508\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wptavern.com/woosesh-virtual-woocommerce-conference-to-be-held-october-18-19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4964:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/woosesh-2018.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://woosesh.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WooSesh</a>, a new two-day virtual conference focused on WooCommerce topics, will be held October 18-19. While wrapping up another successful edition of WordSesh, Brian Richards announced WooSesh as the next event coming under the WordSesh brand. On Wednesday, nearly 500 attendees joined WordSesh. People tuned in from around the world, although the audience was heavily US-based due to the time the event was scheduled.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wordsesh-july-2018.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Since WooConf is not happening this year, WooSesh is an exciting alternative that will be accessible to anyone in the world. Co-organizers Brian Richards and Patrick Rauland will be hosting eight presentations each day, so the event will last between 8-10 hours both days, including breaks and announcements.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once we learned that WooConf wouldn’t be taking place this year we reached out to our friends at Automattic to see if we could work with them as well to still provide a high-quality event but for a much more global audience,&#8221; Richards said.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce is sponsoring the entire event, making it free for all live attendees. Richards said they are working with other prominent companies in the WooCommerce space who are lending their knowledgeable staff as presenters, as well as providing the event with digital swag for attendees.</p>\n<p>WooSesh organizers are employing an interesting concept for encouraging attendance and engagement. The conference will have a $200 ticket price for those who do not attend live. Those who register in advance and attend live will receive the $200 ticket for free.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That means if a person joins the mailing list and shows up for the event, they’ll be able to experience the whole thing at no cost to them,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;Similar to WordSesh, a ticket grants attendees access to the entire broadcast, chat, recordings, real-time transcriptions, and some cool digital swag. But with WooSesh they’ll also get some targeted follow-up content, and perhaps a private community, to further help them succeed and increase the impact of this conference.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And I think it’s in everyone’s best interest to register and attend live – at least trying to make it to one of the sessions across the two days – so they can get all of that for free.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Richards said recordings may still make it out there for people to view afterwards but none of the other perks and follow-ups will be available without purchasing a ticket or attending live.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We talked about asking people for a credit card up front and building a mechanism that would either charge them after the fact (like a pre-order) or charge them up-front but then refund them after the fact,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;Instead we’re going with the simpler route and asking only for a person’s name and email address up-front. If they come to the live event they’ll be able to access all of the content afterwards just as if they had paid, and if they don’t attend live they’ll instead be greeted with a payment form.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Building on their collective knowledge of organizing successful in-person and virtual conferences, Richards said he and his co-organizer wanted to reduce the friction as much as possible for people getting into their seats and engaged with the speakers and other attendees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Making it a virtual event already knocks down a ton of barriers,&#8221; Richard said. &#8220;Making the content available for free eliminates even more.

The event will also host sessions for developers that delve into WooCommerce architecture, performance, how to build and support custom extensions, and how to expand service offerings to better support e-commerce projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our biggest goal with WooSesh is that it will help store builders as well as coders to have more impact with what they build,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;Specifically, we’d like to see them make some measurable progress in their own goals, whether that’s more sales, better customer experiences, greater depth of knowledge, or otherwise. We’re also hoping that some of these talks will inspire attendees to do more than they originally thought possible – either for their own e-commerce stores or for their customers/clients.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 22:34:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: Slack Acquires HipChat, Moves Blog from Medium to WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82681\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/slack-acquires-hipchat-moves-blog-from-medium-to-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2732:\"<p>Slack <a href=\"https://slackhq.com/atlassian-and-slack-partnership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> today that it has acquired HipChat from Atlassian. The friendly rivalry between the two competing group chat platforms will be laid to rest as Slack plans to retire HipChat and Stride.

More than half of the app&#8217;s users are outside the U.S. and 65% of companies in the Fortune 100 pay to use Slack.</p>\n<p>Atlassian and Slack are now joining forces to compete against Microsoft, who jumped into the enterprise collaboration market in 2016 with its Teams product. Teams&#8217; free tier offers support for up to 300 people, with unlimited chat messages and search, and is aimed squarely at competing with Slack.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/slack-blog-e1532659145946.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The news was announced on &#8220;<a href=\"https://slackhq.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Several People Are Typing</a>,&#8221; the official Slack blog, which has just <a href=\"https://medium.com/several-people-are-typing/weve-moved-9cf5941a66fe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">moved from Medium to WordPress</a>.

The below was my response.</em>\r\n\r\nIn short, my view is that bitcoin has not reached a sufficient price to be classified as a bubble. Bubbles are typically defined as an unsustainable increase in the price of some asset well beyond any reasonable approximation of its underlying value. In order to consider whether bitcoin is a bubble or not, we would require some approximation of what its value is as well as some reasoning as to why the current price is unsustainable.\r\n\r\nBitcoin\'s primary function is as an anonymous unit of exchange, i.e. it can be used to perform some online transactions anonymously.  Yet it has problems in that it\'s rarely accepted by mainstream merchants (Expedia.com does for example but this is more the exceptional than the rule).\r\n\r\nIf we were to assume that Bitcoin eventually accrues the critical mass to be a useful unit of exchange (given its recent listing as a future contract on the CME, this may not be an unfair assumption) then we can more easily estimate its value. Global GDP according to the CIA world fact book was $U78.3 trillion in 2014 and it\'s estimated that trade via the black market is circa 20% of world GDP. If we were to assume a mere 10% of this market moves to bitcoin, the 21 million bitcoins (in <u>future</u> existence) would have a transaction value of circa $U1.56 trillion.\r\n\r\nGiven that each bitcoin in the above market estimate is utilised for a transaction several times, we must also adjust our estimates via the velocity of money. A study by ARK Investment Management and Coinbase suggested that circa half of the user base holds bitcoins as an investment (rather than as a unit of exchange). The money velocity of M1 in the US is currently about 5.5x so we adjust the transaction value by 11x (5.5x/.50) rendering a final valuation of circa $U6,780 per bitcoin.\r\n\r\nBased on bitcoin\'s latest price ($U6,900) it appears fair value...yet would 30% of the black market converting to bitcoin be unreasonable? Perhaps not. Whilst we have not taken into account any factor for the time value of monies invested, my view is that bitcoin does not appear to have reached a sufficient price as to satisfy the conditions for being a bubble.\r\n\r\nHowever those with a practical mind will immediately see the gaping hole in this argument - it assumes that bitcoin <strong>is</strong> the cryptocurrency of choice for the black market. Yet why should this be? As noted in an article by Reuters (<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-bitcoin/bitcoins-murkier-rivals-line-up-to-displace-it-as-cybercriminals-favourite-idUSKCN18E2F1\">link here</a>) <em>“If it was me, I would want people to use bitcoin all day, because you can trace it,” said Luke Wilson, vice president for law enforcement at Elliptic, a London-based security firm that tracks illicit bitcoin transactions and that counts the U.S. Federal Bureau for Investigations (FBI) among its clients.\" </em>Hence whilst we might believe that economically bitcoin can justify some upside, if the black market doesn\'t wish to use it due to it\'s trace-ability, it\'s almost surely worth much less than where it\'s currently trading.\r\n\r\nGiven the risks and hole in it\'s value proposition, we\'d be quite comfortable in passing on any opportunity to invest in bitcoin or its associated derivatives.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Is Bitcoin a bubble?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'is-bitcoin-a-bubble', '', '', '2018-08-23 11:33:02', '2018-08-23 11:33:02', '', 0, 'http://vegacapital.net/2018/01/17/uber-is-selling-off-its-auto-leasing-business-copy/', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Decisions based on information contained on </em><em>this Website are the sole responsibility of the visitor whom we would </em><em>encourage to seek relevant advice from a licenced professional.</em>\r\n\r\nThere\'s no escaping that if you sell a put option, you are taking on a small but very real risk that you could owe the buyer of said option a lot of money in the future. This is actually a necessity. To illustrate, let\'s consider the following example.\r\n\r\nThe Vega fund recently wrote an option on the QQQ (NASDAQ mini index) for $600 per contract that has 113 days to expiry with a strike of 150. The QQQ at the time was trading at about 157 so we have somewhat of a buffer before the strike. We\'re required to put up about $2400 in margin so our return is 25% for 113 days. By inspection, we can see that before we begin to take a loss, the QQQ would need to fall from 157 to below 144 (9%) by July which is not impossible but is statistically unlikely. Since the probability of a loss is unlikely, the probability of profit by reflection is likely.\r\n\r\nI\'m sure you can see where I\'m going with this - for a likely as well as high return over such a short period, the writer of this contract must be willing to accept a large loss if the QQQ falls a lot. Otherwise, there\'s nothing in it for the buyer of the contract and the trade won\'t occur. As custodians of our clients capital, this presents downside risk which we must manage.\r\n\r\nWe first note that whilst the option will pay us a 25% return, Vega\'s proprietary model tells us that the \'fair\' return should only be 15% (a margin of safety of 10%). This means that option buyers are craving security so much that they\'re willing to pay over the fair price for it - a happy coincidence as we\'re willing to sell overpriced options. Hence the contract isn\'t really fair - we have a mathematical edge from the start. This doesn\'t mean that we can\'t take a loss on this particular trade (it\'s just that we have a bigger buffer for losses than we theoretically should have).\r\n\r\nVega\'s algorithm will only ever enter into mis-priced securities which adds to both downside protection and investor returns over time.\r\n\r\nWe can further reduce the potential for a large loss by only selling option premium in less risky economic times whilst moving to cash or buying protection during risky times. As many of those reading will know, The Vega Fund has a set of algorithms which determine how risky the economy and financial markets are. Currently the algorithms are telling us that the risk of a big loss is low (but such a view is subject to continuous monitoring so please, don\'t take this as a recommendation). In doing this, we further skew the odds and returns in favour of our investors.\r\n\r\nFinally, in conjunction to Vega\'s portfolio, we run a separate portfolio which hedges against sudden unforeseeable market drops - especially useful for this particular investment.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, due to lucrative option premiums and a strong economic environment Vega is currently writing options over many broad based market indices but is then also taking on risk which must be managed. Vega manages portfolio risk against the broader economic/financial environment, hedging excess risk and only entering into contracts with a good margin of safety.\r\n\r\nThe Vega fund will be open to sophisticated investors <strong>by invitation</strong> from the 1st of July 2018.', 'How Vega minimises downside risk', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-vega-minimises-downside-risk', '', '', '2018-08-23 11:32:19', '2018-08-23 11:32:19', '', 0, 'http://vegacapital.net/2018/01/17/bitcoin-is-the-gag-gift-copy/', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Now if this were a simple process then everyone would be doing it but since it’s quite complicated, we’re going to outlay a little of our thinking on the matter.\r\n\r\nCycles typically have four parts, an expansion, a peak, a recession and a recovery. To start we can make some fairly obvious observations about the US economy.\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>It doesn’t appear to be in recession.</li>\r\n 	<li>It has experienced a recovery post the contraction of 2009.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich leaves us to wonder whether the current economy is in an expansionary phase or has peaked. It would be difficult to determine the answer with 100 per cent certainty so we’ll speak in terms of probabilities.\r\n\r\nIf you’re a frequent reader of Howard Mark’s literature you’ll have read his January memo to clients (<a href=\"https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/latest-thinking.pdf\">link</a>). Marks\' makes some pertinent economic observations:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><em>The U.S. economy is chugging along, and the recovery that started in 2009 has become one of the longest in history (103 months old at this point). The rest of the world’s economies are joining in for that rare thing, worldwide growth. Most economies seem to be gaining rather than losing steam, and they don’t appear likely to run out of it anytime soon.”</em></li>\r\n 	<li><em>Since the economic recovery hasn’t been marked by excesses to the upside, when a recession eventually does occur, it doesn’t have to be extreme. In short, no boom, no bust.</em></li>\r\n 	<li><em>The unemployment rate is down to 4.1%, nearly the lowest level in 60 years, meaning we’re nearing “full employment” (albeit with an unusually low percentage of adults participating in the workforce). </em></li>\r\n 	<li><em>The low levels of inflation worldwide mean central bankers needn’t rush to raise interest rates to restrain it. There’s no obvious reason to predict hyperinflation. Thus the near-term rise in interest rates – while probable – can be expected to be gradual and limited in scope.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo in short the economy appears to be growing and economic indicators are positive. Given this as well as Vega’s algorithm based economic analysis, we would estimate that the likelihood that US is still expanding is perhaps 60/70% and the likelihood of a peak 30/40% - perhaps the latter more recently elevated by the possibility of a trade war between the US and China - but let’s not get carried away.\r\n\r\nThe latest economic data point for the US economy has been non-farm payrolls and the unemployment rate which came out Friday at 4.1% (consensus expectations was 4.0%). Since the economy is close to full employment, the natural process would be for wages from here to increase and lead to later inflation and some tempering via interest rates, but this is a gradual process as Marks noted.\r\n\r\nSo how is Vega’s option portfolio positioned for this environment given this view? Like Marks, we’re cautiously optimistic. The Vega portfolio is tilted towards expecting an inflation in stock market prices over the medium term. Economic risk however is increasing.\r\n\r\nOur hedging book is well placed to withstand any unforeseeable market volatility and we’re pleased with the margin of safety between market prices and the valuation of our portfolio. Given another quote from the memo, this seems prudent.\r\n\r\n<em>“Most valuation parameters are either the richest ever (Buffett ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP, price-to-sales ratio, the VIX, bond yields, private equity transaction multiples, real estate capitalisation ratios) or among the highest in history (p/e ratios, Shiller cycle-adjusted p/e ratio).”</em><!-- <fw_preview_session>1523192429084</fw_preview_session> -->', 'How does Vega see the US economic cycle?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-does-vega-see-the-us-economic-cycle', '', '', '2018-08-23 11:31:14', '2018-08-23 11:31:14', '', 0, 'http://vegacapital.net/?p=2051', 0, 'post', '', 0),

So does this mean we’ve become suddenly bearish on the US economy?\r\n\r\nIn short <strong>no</strong>. To answer this question, we must understand how Vega views cash as an investment. Cash as observed by Warren Buffet is one of the poorest investments available – it by default provides no real capital growth over time and hence to hold significant quantities of cash is an inefficient use of capital.\r\n\r\nTypically, many investors will hold a portion of their portfolio in cash – waiting for an opportunistic entry into an investment or because there doesn’t appear to be ample investment opportunities in the market. Yet Vega is not finding investment opportunities to be scarce – quite the contrary, there are many.\r\n\r\nVega is holding 50 per cent of its portfolio in cash for several reasons.\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>The investments in the portfolio have already very high payoffs, so even with substantial levels of cash, the portfolio has been constructed with a high probability of out-performance. Hence the portfolio does not need to take on more risk than it already is.</li>\r\n 	<li>Vega will always hold ample reserves of cash in order to handle any short term events where volatility is elevated. It’s notable that due to the high volatility of the options market, new opportunities arise at a higher frequency than that of the stock market.</li>\r\n 	<li>There is the potential for even better opportunities to arise which require higher levels of margin capital – the Vega Fund is hence well positioned to take advantage of these events.</li>\r\n 	<li>There is little need to go over-weight on risk when the market is fairly mature and economic/geopolitical risks are rising.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nHence we have a solid case for holding significant quantities of cash. We may hold more or less in the future, but that depends on what opportunities are out there and economic risk levels.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, the implied return of Vega’s cash reserves is more than just interest earned, it\'s allows us to easily position into better opportunities and hold the portfolio through volatile periods. In addition, the Vega portfolio has ample exposure and embedded alpha sufficient to generate market beating levels of performance for our clients.\r\n\r\nThe Vega fund will be open to sophisticated investors <strong>by invitation</strong> from the 1st of July 2018.\r\n\r\n<!-- <fw_preview_session>1523848878574</fw_preview_session> -->', 'Vega holds 50 per cent cash….are we bearish?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'vega-has-60-per-cent-cash-are-we-bearish', '', '', '2018-08-23 11:30:31', '2018-08-23 11:30:31', '', 0, 'http://vegacapital.net/?p=2066', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Decisions based on information contained on this Website are the sole responsibility of the visitor whom we would encourage to seek relevant advice from a licenced professional.</em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nReaders will recall that the Vega Fund recently (see <a href=\"http://vegacapital.net/2018/03/29/how-vega-minimises-downside-risk/\">here</a>) held a short position in some July 150 strike put options on the NASDAQ mini index (QQQ). At the time these options had an inflated premium of $6 (Vega entered at $6.30) as technology stocks came under pressure amid the Facebook inquiry, the crash of an autonomous car and concerns that governments would regulate companies such as Facebook and Google more stringently.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy at the Vega Fund is that these events are largely noise. Looking longer term, most firms (not all) which dominate market indices have strong competitive positions and a long run of profitability ahead of them whether regulated or not….One must remember that the Tobacco industry enjoyed many a profitable year post heavy regulation – a counter-intuitive fact!\r\n\r\nHowever a July 2018 put is not a long term bet - it’s clearly short term. The underlying stock index should behave largely randomly within this time-frame hence we employed statistics combined with Vega’s macroeconomic analysis to assess the opportunity and risk. The outcome of this was that the option which was yielding a 25 per cent return to July if priced fairly should have offered only 15 per cent or less (embedded alpha of 10 per cent). In addition, whilst a financial market shock was possible, it was also statically unlikely. Hence combined with some hedges against disaster and as one of many positions in the portfolio, Vega wrote the put.\r\n\r\nSaid put is now trading for around $3.20 and in our view isn’t such a compelling opportunity anymore. The potential returns have fallen considerably and the risks are changing. As options approach maturity, they become more sensitive to market shocks relative to that of options which have more time until expiration. The reason is that if there is a sudden drop in the market, the near term option may go in-the-money and not have ample time for the market price to correct before expiration.\r\n\r\nHowever new opportunities have arisen elsewhere – particularly in the SPY (S&amp;P500 SPDR mini) and we have redeployed capital accordingly.\r\n\r\nVega last week wrote a put option on March 2019 SPY 260 puts for $13.40 (last price was $13.90 so we’re down slightly). We received $1,340 per put and put up around $4,400 in margin per put. The return on capital employed at the time was around 30 per cent with embedded alpha of 5 per cent (at fair value, the option should have only been offering a 25 per cent return).\r\n\r\nOur outlook on the SPY is neutral to positive and this is required for a written put position to yield us a return. The economy in our view is strong (see <a href=\"http://vegacapital.net/2018/04/08/how-does-vega-see-the-us-economic-cycle/\">here</a>), price momentum has weakened (not conclusively) and volatility clustering post the February correction has abated. Now this opportunity is nowhere as good as the QQQ trade prior however with a 30 per cent potential return on capital employed it was a welcome addition to the portfolio.\r\n\r\nIt’s important we clarify however that this trade on the SPY has not been made in isolation, it\'s one part of a much larger portfolio and has been made in conjunction with various hedges. <strong>Hence we’re not advising clients or readers to make the same trade</strong>.

Take a coin and a chessboard. This coin fits perfectly within a square on the chessboard. Now if you dropped the coin onto the chessboard, what is the likelihood that the coin covers the corner of four chessboard squares?\r\n\r\nNow intuitively this likelihood would seem to be rather small or large (depending on who you ask). But actually <a href=\"https://www.braingle.com/brainteasers/teaser.php?op=2&amp;id=43993&amp;comm=0\">if you do the math</a>, there’s almost a fair chance of this occurring (47.6 per cent).\r\n\r\nHumans intuitively are poor judges of probability. The economist Robert Shiller regularly takes a survey of investor’s thoughts on the market. One question he asks is for the participants to judge the probability of a catastrophic market crash within the next six months. Now statistically, the likelihood of such an event is about 1 per cent, however over the last 25 years, participants have assigned a 19 per cent mean probability to such an event.\r\n\r\nSo why is this the case? To be fair, probabilities are hard to account for in the market for many reasons.\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Market participants are subject to bias – informational, emotional and behavioural.</li>\r\n 	<li>There is not always a standardised method to estimate probability.</li>\r\n 	<li>We are subject to only using a subset of all known information. And new information is coming in all the time.</li>\r\n 	<li>Financial markets are a complex system – the way in which it behaves varies over time.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nLet’s now consider an example a friend asked for my advice on recently and then discuss the approach that Vega would use.\r\n\r\nLet’s say we’re considering buying a security. It is believed that the security will be worth $5.00 if event X occurs, $5.20 if event Y occurs and $3.50 if neither of the two occur (call this event Z). The market mostly believes X will occur and so the security is currently trading for $4.70.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the market is most probably right (call it 65 per cent chance) but also believed that Y could occur (25 per cent chance). Event Z is viewed as most unlikely although possible (10 per cent chance). The source of these probability estimates is investor\'s experience in the market over time.\r\n\r\nBased on this information, what should we do? Most investors will attempt to calculate the expected profit from each scenario and find the sum total. In this case, the expected profit from such a transaction is 20 cents.\r\n\r\nWe’re ignoring the time component of this trade – obviously if it were to take 1 month, it’s more favourable than if it were to take 1 year. Hence if the duration were short, it might be considered a worthwhile investment. What I want to focus on though is two things.\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Unlike in our coin example, we have no reliable way to demonstrate that the probability estimates are accurate. Probabilities based on investor\'s experience in the market (as we can see from Shiller\'s example) can be very wrong.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>The probability estimates are hence based on nothing more than bias and perception. </strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nNow if the upside cases were to emerge, this matters less - we\'ve made money. But what if the $3.50 case emerged? We don’t wish to make the same mistake that Shiller’s survey participants did in overestimating the risk - but since <strong>we don’t actually know</strong> whether the probability is 1 per cent or 50 per cent or even roughly what it is, it makes sense to consider the downside risk more stringently.\r\n\r\nWe’re also ignoring the fact that making a bet based on probabilities for a scenario which has only 1 step has issues. Whilst the probability of realising the $5.20 case may be 65 per cent, in reality, it either happens or it doesn’t. Many trials are required to make theory a reality.\r\n\r\nVega’s approach would be to pass on such an opportunity - this is unless the duration were sufficiently short, some downside risk could be hedged away and we could more reliably assess the probable outcomes through statistical and economic analysis. Such an approach is the driving force behind Vega’s stellar back test results. As it turns out, being humble pays dividends.\r\n\r\nIn the coming weeks, we’ll be releasing details of our 25 year back test which demonstrates Vega’s strong returns over many bull and bear markets.\r\n\r\n<!-- <fw_preview_session>1525350087701</fw_preview_session> -->', 'How Vega uses probability to outperform', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-vega-uses-probability-to-outperform', '', '', '2018-08-23 11:27:50', '2018-08-23 11:27:50', '', 0, 'http://vegacapital.net/?p=2098', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Overall this was an uneventful month.\r\n\r\nThe Vega Fund is a long term strategy. 3.3 per cent for the first month is certainly pleasing, but negligible relative to performance over the long term.\r\n\r\nWe are currently in the final stages of agreements for administration, AFSL and other standard fund requirements.

The objectives of a central bank may differ somewhat between countries but they generally have a similar approach – rising inflation is contained with higher interest rates and vice versa.\r\n\r\nInflation typically occurs when economies are going a little too well (I’ve clarified with ‘typically’ to exclude events such as Germany’s hyperinflation of the 1920’s and the like). For example, as an economy reaches output capacity it leads to a tighter labour market which spurs wage increases and then more spending/borrowing. Over time, inflation results.\r\n\r\nNow let’s introduce the stock market. A simple valuation model for stocks is the Gordon Growth Model which can be expressed as follows.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2140 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Econ-pic-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"432\" height=\"56\" />\r\n\r\nThe rate of discount is key here because it’s the sum of (i) the risk free rate (set by the central bank) and (ii) the risk premium. Hence if the central bank raises rates, this places downside pressure on the valuation that the stock market can achieve. Indeed, the Fed has been raising rates and is expected to continue to do so.\r\n\r\nSo should we be worried about lower stock prices in the future ? Well let’s not forget earnings and earnings growth. As noted prior, for interest rates to rise we need excess inflation as a result of an economy which is beginning to overheat. What would we expect in such an environment? Higher earnings. This puts upward pressure on valuations which can offset the downward pressure of interest rates.\r\n\r\n(There are exceptions to this theory but let’s stick to the standard model).\r\n\r\nThis is why despite the uptick in fed rates over the 2004-2008 period, the stock market kept climbing.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2141 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Econ-pic-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"481\" height=\"289\" />\r\n\r\nNegative returns only result when the economy’s debt burden becomes too heavy, which then requires consumers to cuts spending to pay back their debts (a deleveraging). And which then results in lower income for others (a recession begins).\r\n\r\nSo let\'s bring this framework back to what we\'re seeing in the US economy;\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/15/feds-kaplan-sees-us-inflation-rising-but-not-running-away.html\">The Fed see’s inflation as rising but not an issue</a>. This appears to be a fair assessment. This is also why rate increases have been small in nature - there\'s little inflation for the Fed to fight.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2142\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Econ-pic-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"601\" height=\"289\" />\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Household debt as a function of GDP ($15.6 trillion, 78.7% of GDP) is at subdued levels.</li>\r\n 	<li>Corporate non financial debt ($14.3 trillion, 73.5% of GDP) by the same measure is as high as it was prior to the GFC. Serviceability of said debt is obviously a function of the health of the economy and the magnitude of future interest rate rises – particularly for those companies on the high yield end of the spectrum.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2143\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Econ-pic-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"603\" height=\"346\" />\r\n\r\nOn the latter there is some cause for concern. Over the coming 5 years, approximately $2 trillion of this debt rolls over. That’s a lot of debt to clear in an environment with increasing interest rates.\r\n\r\nWe’ll be discussing this topic more in the coming weeks.\r\n\r\nIn other news, the Vega Fund is on schedule to be launched on the 1<sup>st</sup> of July 2018. There will be two investment options for investors – one via Interactive Brokers in which an amount of capital may be delegated towards Vega for management. The second is standard whereby investors may purchase units in a unit trust which is administered by a third party.\r\n\r\nEach option will have the same portfolio, returns, fees and other fund characteristics.\r\n\r\nForms and contacts will be placed on the website once our AFSL requirements and administration required are finalised over the next few weeks.

The reason was market concerns around Italy’s new right wing government – the Five Star party and how it may effect Italy’s finances as well as its standing or even membership of the European Bloc. Some poor results from a couple of US companies didn\'t help either.\r\n\r\nAs of the time of writing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.7 per cent and yet the Vega portfolio was down only 0.25 per cent as a result of our hedges kicking in. It’s actually surprising that such news has had any market impact given that none of this is new information. Further, such events are insignificant in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\nYet - since the Vega Fund is in its early stage, I believe it’s worth us commenting on such a topic to explain how the algorithm deals with these issues (which occur commonly) and why our philosophy considers these events as simply noise.\r\n\r\nThere are two main concerns, the first is that Italy will default on its public debt. The second is that Italy will leave the Bloc.\r\n\r\nFirstly the latter raises the risk of the former since it shows that the government is willing to engage in radical measures to achieve its goals. Italy will likely pay higher interest rates on future debt issues outside of the Bloc than inside it which increases default prospects. But remember, a big funder of the Italian debt is Italian citizens – which would mean that Italy essentially defaults on itself – an odd conundrum.\r\n\r\nItaly has an economy operating with debt levels of more than 130 per cent of GDP. This makes life difficult because if interest rates are say 3 per cent, it’s interest bill per annum is higher than GDP growth and to escape from this requires large cuts in spending (austerity) – of which we know creates a weak/recessionary economy and makes the prospect of growth hard to achieve.\r\n\r\nTo bring this back to Vega’s algorithm and how it handles such events, at this stage we would need to see it create a significant amount of trade destabilisation which then precipitates into a more broad-based global economic contraction and unemployment.\r\n\r\nSince today’s events are not likely to impact these variables so significantly, we can see why Vega’s algorithm would largely ignore it - hence our portfolio is still long market exposure.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to what the back test results showed when Greece was in the news – a lot of noise, but little real risk.', 'The Eurozone is back in the news', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-eurozone-is-back-in-the-news', '', '', '2018-08-23 11:24:36', '2018-08-23 11:24:36', '', 0, 'https://vegacapital.net/?p=2174', 0, 'post', '', 0),

His view is that other countries are engaging in unfair trading practices which impact Americans in an adverse way.\r\n\r\nAnd the truth is that yes – competition from cheaper resources or labour from overseas does impact some workers negatively. This is not something we can dismiss because it’s real people, not just statistics that we’re talking about.\r\n\r\nHowever when formulating policy, there’s no reason not to engage in practices which vastly improve the quality of life outcomes for the majority of the populous. Programs and policies can be devised and funded to support the less fortunate however it’s up to the government to ensure that they’re executed well.\r\n\r\nNow what benefits am I talking about? Well there are many but I want to draw attention to just one – wealth. Consider the last several hundred years since the beginning of the industrial revolution. What is noticeable is the vast improvement in the wealth state of all citizens. It’s been the greatest upheaval of citizens from poverty to prosperity that has ever occurred in human history.\r\n\r\nThrough technology and practices, we’ve enable our society to become infinitely more productive i.e. producing more goods &amp; services and hence enjoy a higher quality of life.\r\n\r\nTariffs are a reversal of that trend – it\'s taking value from both consumers and producers by artificially inflating the price of goods and services and transferring that value to the government. The consumer budget becomes more stretched, producers are less incentivised to compete (especially tariff protected producers) and there’s less money left for innovation and product/service improvements.\r\n\r\nThis is even before we consider the adverse effects of the government essentially picking winners and losers in the market place.\r\n\r\nThe costs of a tariff are not equally spread however – obviously if you are a tariff protected producer then you don’t have a cost – in fact you get a benefit. However consumers of imported products in competition with the local producers obviously lose. In addition, jobs which depend on prior low prices of the tariff protected product lose out and this can be a much larger population than of those said tariff was originally trying to protect.\r\n\r\nFor example, whilst steel tariff may benefit steel producers, they hurt car manufacturers and other businesses which do better with low steel prices. Hence whilst you might save some jobs within the steel producing industries, you lose jobs elsewhere which damages the economy on a net basis.\r\n\r\nThe derivative effect of tariffs of course is that other countries retaliate which compounds the problem (and which is now occurring). You end up in a tit-for-tat of tariff trading which benefits a few at the expense of the many. It’s a wealth reducing set of circumstances which would have negative outcomes for both economies and markets.\r\n\r\nAt Vega, we don’t believe that this is something which is likely to result in hugely adverse consequences for the market unless President Trump makes a habit of such measures – unfortunately there is a small probability that he may well do.\r\n\r\nInvestors should know however that if a tariff war were to begin to impact the US economy, our algorithms which monitor this data will act - aiming to both minimise the downside risk and maximise the upside potential.\r\n\r\nThe Vega Fund will be formally opened on the 1<sup>st</sup> of July 2018 to sophisticated and wholesale investors.

Let’s start off today’s blog by putting some numbers around the topic.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/historical/gands.pdf\">According to Census.gov</a>, US imported goods and services were valued at $2.9 trillion in 2017. China exports to the US were circa $500 billion hence meaning that Chinese exports comprised 17 per cent of US imports – clearly not a small number.\r\n\r\nUS exports of goods and services to China are valued at $120/$130 billion resulting in a trade deficit of approximately $380 billion in favour of China.\r\n\r\nEarlier last week, the Trump Administration put forth a plan to place tariffs across $46.2b of Chinese exports to the US. China responded with its own tariffs across $49.8b of US exports to which President Trump retaliated with a plan for tariffs accross an additional $200b goods and services as well the threat of another $200b if they retaliated again.\r\n\r\nThe below info-graphic (compiled by Chad P Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics) gives us an idea about what exports are affected prior to Trumps escalation of $200b of tariffed Chinese exports.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2630\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pic-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"284\" height=\"369\" /> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2631\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pic-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"306\" height=\"369\" />\r\n\r\nSummed up, the Presidents threats now comprise circa 90 per cent of China’s exports to the US - approximately 15.5 per cent of total US imports.\r\n\r\nAs we discussed in our <a href=\"https://vegacapital.net/2018/06/14/tariffs-why/\">previous blog</a>, the impact is not just on the producers of the tariff protected goods – it’s on all the downstream producers/services relying on that good. Hence the cost of these tariffs can be very widespread. In addition, most economists would agree that the costs of a tariff outweigh the benefits gained by the protected goods and services.\r\n\r\nAdd on top of this the fact that the President is also pushing tariffs onto Mexico, Canada and the European Union….who are in turn retaliating with their own tariffs over many billions of US exports.\r\n\r\nThe economic benefits which accrue to nations as a result of free trade are quite well known – hence all these actions seem very irrational and many suspect that this is less of a real threat by the President and is more posturing. Time will tell.\r\n\r\nChina of course can’t retaliate with its own tariff of $200b because the US isn\'t exporting that much to them. But it can attempt to make the US\' agenda in Asia more complicated. North Korea or The South China Sea would seem the obvious choices from that angle. It doesn’t appear likely however that China will be able to back down since the President has given them no face-saving way of accomplishing this feat.\r\n\r\nThe President however can back down and whilst many believe that that he’s too stubborn for this, I’m less sure. President Trump often has a more…fluid approach to policy making and we might be having a very different conversation by next month (or next week).\r\n\r\nThe most sensible option at this point would be for China and the US to meet, curb tensions and have both sides walk away declaring victory. However unlikely this scenario seems at this hour, its realisation wouldn’t surprise me.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if these issues continue to escalate, (in my own view) it just might be enough to impair the economic growth of the US over the short to medium term which would likely have a negative impact on financial markets.\r\n\r\nThe Vega portfolio doesn’t operate via ‘views’ however – as it stands the Vega economic algorithms are bullish, hence so is the portfolio and despite stock markets falling over the past couple of days, the portfolio is holding up quite well via it\'s hedging book. Our algorithms continue to monitor economic data and will make any required changes accordingly.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, if economic growth does become impaired over the medium term, our back tests have shown that such an occurrence is one in which the Vega portfolio can perform exceptionally well.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Vega Capital is a Corporate Authorised Representative (No. 001264482) of Alpha Securities Pty Ltd (ACN 124 327 064) AFS Licence No. 330757.</em>', 'Tariffs…Why?

Our active risk positions generated a 14 per cent return and hedging positions detracted 8.3 per cent – netting 5.7 per cent.\r\n\r\nSince we’re finishing a quarter, it’s worth a brief review of what we’re observing in the US economy and comment on how Vega is positioning itself.\r\n\r\nWe’ll first start on tariffs. For those just catching up – we previously blogged about tariffs <a href=\"https://vegacapital.net/2018/06/21/tariffswhy-part-2/\">here</a>. These are a concern since if President Trump were to follow through on his threats to further expand tariffs to include all Chinese exports, this significantly increases the probability that the US will go into a recession.\r\n\r\nAs this occurs, the Vega Fund will likely begin to reposition itself from being bullish to bearish. It’s apparent that in such a circumstance that neither the US Government nor the Federal Reserve will have the firepower necessary to combat such an issue with stimulus. Further, prices for stocks appear high and given that the authorities have little in reserve should something go wrong, the downside is likely quite large.\r\n\r\nThis presents a very rare opportunity for the Vega Fund to generate outsized returns.  We can’t say with certainty that it will occur – only that our algorithms will be monitoring closely.\r\n\r\nNot all we’re seeing is bad news and notably the fund has still been positioned long (with hedges in place). Over the last quarter, US employment numbers have been not been stronger for over 16 years.\r\n\r\nThe unemployment rate in June increased to 4.0 per cent from 3.8 per cent back in May as a result of a 600,000 increase in the number of citizens seeking work. It will be interesting to see how they fair over the next month.\r\n\r\nInterest rates still appear cyclically low despite having quite a hawkish Federal Reserve board. As many have observed, if we were to quote an unemployment rate of 4.0 per cent, the S&amp;P500 at record highs, inflation at 2.8 per cent, where would we expect interest rates? Certainly higher than 2 per cent....\r\n\r\nIn 2015, 2016 and 2017 it was understandable that the Fed wouldn’t raise rates too quickly because inflation was tempered. However now it has to temper raising so as not to elevate systemic risks given how much debt has been issued by corporates.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2649 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pic-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"352\" />\r\n\r\nTempering would also be required should tariffs begin to have a negative impact on economic growth. As such, it could still be a while before we reach a more normal interest rate environment.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Vega Fund has now formally launched and is open to sophisticated and wholesale investors.

We also broke this number down into returns from our active risk positions (+14 per cent) and our hedging book (-8.3 per cent).\r\n\r\nNaturally, investors may wonder why hedging is required when it’s clearly so costly. After all, if we didn’t hedge, we could deliver much higher returns. But this is only true if nothing goes wrong. The benefit of hedging occurs when things do go wrong.\r\n\r\nSo today we’re going to run some simulations to see the benefit of Vega’s hedging algorithm.\r\n\r\nLet’s run the Vega strategy on some historical data using just SPY puts with a duration of 12 to 18 months. We’re firstly not going to hedge in order to see how volatile the portfolio’s performance gets and emphasise the value of hedging.\r\n\r\nThe period we’re going to test over is the first half of FY11. Over this period, the US lost its AAA credit rating which caused a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(2011)\">minor panic in the markets</a>.\r\n\r\nTo start, here’s how the index did over that period.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2674 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hedge-pic-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"481\" height=\"289\" />\r\n\r\nAs above, the SPY declined by 6.3 per cent. At its worst it was down 18.8 per cent. Annualised volatility was 30 per cent – clearly a rough patch.\r\n\r\nVega’s portfolio at this time would have been long market exposure due to the strengthening economy and expensive put option prices. Clearly with the index falling from 135 to 110, a portfolio of written puts is going to fare quite badly but this is what Vega would have had.\r\n\r\nSo let’s look at how Vega performed <strong>without</strong> the hedging algorithm.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2675 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hedge-pic-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"481\" height=\"289\" />\r\n\r\nIn short – not well. The strategy lost 6.1 per cent for the half, what was worse however was the &gt; 40 per cent drawdown incurred. Annualised volatility for the period was a gut wrenching 77 per cent. Quite clearly, this is not an experience we would hope to incur in the Vega portfolio.\r\n\r\nThe index lost 6.3 per cent so technically the strategy outperformed. However at Vega we don’t consider a negative return as outperformance – even if it beats the index.\r\n\r\nNow let’s <strong>add back in</strong> the hedging algorithm and see how Vega performs.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2677 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hedge-pic-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"481\" height=\"289\" />\r\n\r\nWhat a difference! By using the hedging book, the strategy is able to hold on during the market collapse and then also capture the upside from the recovery. There’s still a draw-down of 16.4 per cent and elevated volatility of 43 per cent (annualised) however Vega returned 21.7 per cent over the period – outperforming by 28 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe value of hedging is hence very apparent. Vega can generate strong returns in bull markets even if hedging is expensive and this is a good trade off to ensure it can generate returns in weaker markets.\r\n\r\nThe Vega Fund has now formally launched and is open to sophisticated and wholesale investors.

This is notably where Vega has the potential to really shine.\r\n\r\nLet’s start by looking at the SPY. The index began 2008 at circa 145 and capitulated 38.6 per cent over the year to below 89. Annualised volatility was 41.3 per cent for this period. This was one of the worst markets for investors since the Great Depression.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2692 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hedge-pic-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"447\" height=\"270\" />\r\n\r\nAnd admittedly, if it weren’t for the actions of The Federal Reserve, The US Treasury and many members of the exiting Bush Administration and entering Obama Administration, it might well have been the Second Great Depression. I always credit Ben Bernanke, Timothy Geithner, Hank Paulson and President Barrack Obama in particular for their huge roles in stabilising the Global Financial System at this time.\r\n\r\nSo let’s see how Vega would have performed over this period using SPY put options with a duration of 6 to 12 months.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2693 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hedge-pic-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"467\" height=\"282\" />\r\n\r\nThe returns are clearly large...so what happened? In the simulation, Vega during 2007 had been long market exposure through writing put options across various market indices. By late in 2007, it had liquidated all its positions into cash. In late April of of 2008, it began buying puts and also entered into some hedges.\r\n\r\nBy year end, the simulation results show that Vega would have generated a 142 per cent return on capital employed. Versus the index, this represents circa 180 percentage points of out-performance. Annualised volatility was rather high at 55 per cent, however this is a small price to pay for such a high return. In addition, the strategy was rather inefficient between October and December and had some rough draw-downs, although not as bad as what the SPY would have experienced over the year.\r\n\r\nOverall, if this were the result of our portfolio over this timeframe, we’d be quite pleased. <strong>But please note a few important points to consider upon reviewing these performance numbers.</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>The simulation is limited in nature.

Other positions on other assets and strike prices may have generated lesser returns.</li>\r\n 	<li>The simulation was done on a portfolio of long SPY put options. In future we’ll most likely have the algorithm use <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearputspread.asp\">bear put spreads</a> to achieve high returns but with lower downside risk to reduce the impact if our models were to be wrong.</li>\r\n 	<li>Past performance does not equal a promise of future returns. The GFC was a very volatile event and in the simulation Vega was able to capture the downside well. Yet future crises may be less severe which would obviously mean the potential for returns is lesser.</li>\r\n 	<li>Events like this don’t occur every year.

We’re looking forward to fielding questions from investors about the markets, our portfolio and the business itself.</li>\r\n 	<li>I will also be meeting with Sarah Harding of WY Advice for her popular ‘Wealth Wednesdays’ segment in early August. We’ll post a copy of the video on the blog for readers as soon as it’s available.</li>\r\n 	<li>Finally, in addition to publishing weekly on this blog, we will also be publishing new regular content on Livewire.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nToday we’re providing a brief update on some trading and the portfolio\'s positioning. Last week we rolled part of the portfolio which held some QQQ index puts opened back in May and redeployed capital by writing SPY index puts.\r\n\r\nThe Vega fund has two conditions in its algorithm which allow for rolling,\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Roll any option with less than 6 months to maturity; or</li>\r\n 	<li>Roll any option whose premium has collapsed significantly in value such that there are better opportunities elsewhere.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nFor the QQQ index puts, we received $787 per contract and bought them back for $240 per contract. We’ve then rolled into some 265 strike December 2019 puts on the SPY index for $1,344 per contract. These appear 5 per cent mispriced and offer a total 23.5 per cent per annum return on capital.\r\n\r\nSince inception our fund has been bullish on the market and this has paid off. Macroeconomic indicators are green and so is momentum hence we’re still comfortable with our long market exposure. We do however have an array of hedges in place going into August to take advantage of any shocks from tariffs or the US reporting season.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Vega Fund has now formally launched and is open to sophisticated and wholesale investors.

If you don’t understand that’s going to happen, then you’re not ready, you won’t do well in the markets”. </em>Today I’m going to discuss some ways in which investors can protect their portfolios from downside risk.\r\n\r\nWe employ almost all of these methods at The Vega Fund.\r\n\r\n<strong>Diversification</strong>\r\n\r\nInvestors can reduce downside exposure (particularly from idiosyncratic risk) by being diversified across individual stocks and sectors. This is particularly important for investors with little time to research industries and individual stocks since idiosyncratic risks are best monitored by professionals who can do so on a continuous basis.\r\n\r\nDuring a recession however, diversification amongst stocks is unlikely enough to protect from falls in prices. This is where diversification amongst negatively correlated asset classes can help.\r\n\r\n<strong>Negatively correlated assets</strong>\r\n\r\nAn asset having negative correlation with respect to stocks simply means that when the price of said stocks fall, the price for this asset will rise. One example of this is a put option which will increase in value as the underlying stock it’s written on falls in price.\r\n\r\nHowever you don’t necessarily need to pay for a put in order to have downside protection. An investor could sell a call option, effectively selling some upside in their investment to hedge some downside risk.\r\n\r\nOther alternatives involve buying a VIX future contract. Typically during a correction or recession, stock price volatility will spike. Since the VIX future contract is linked to stock price volatility (via the implied volatility of options), it will increase in value during a negative market event.\r\n\r\nBy introducing negatively correlated assets into our portfolio, we\'re effectively hedging said portfolio. We can improve the effectiveness of our hedging by increasing the number of hedges we hold as stock prices rise and reduce them as stock prices fall. Since hedges are typically cheaper in rising markets and more expensive in falling markets, we end up buying our hedges at a low price and selling them at a higher price. As such, we can actually both protect our portfolio and earn returns over time.\r\n\r\nIn the below we\'ve attempted to show this as an example. We start in period 1 with our portfolio - 2 units of stocks and 2 units of VIX.\r\n\r\nIn period 2, stock prices fall by 50 per cent and the VIX increases by 50 per cent. We hold our stocks and sell down 1 unit of VIX for a profit of 5.\r\n\r\nIn period 3, both the stock market and VIX normalise back to their original prices. We still get to keep 5 in profit from the prior market moves. The VIX position is also built back up to 2 units.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2751 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/vix-pic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"440\" height=\"221\" />\r\n\r\nThis is a simplified example but provides the intuition on how Vega usually manages downside risk.\r\n\r\n<strong>Holding cash</strong>\r\n\r\nHolding cash in our view is one of the least preferred options to mitigating downside risk. That said, we do hold a lot of cash in our portfolio (circa 50 per cent) but this is acting as reserve capital for our derivatives positions as opposed to a means of downside protection.\r\n\r\nThe issue with cash is that it’s guaranteed to under-perform over time relative to a portfolio of stocks or other risk assets. As such, it adds a continuous negative drag to a portfolio’s returns. Since recessions are often years apart, the opportunity cost of the drag is actually quite large.\r\n\r\nEven if the portfolio weightings of cash are adjusted over time based on stock valuations, cash may still be a drag on performance if stock prices rise despite appearing expensive.\r\n\r\nWe believe it’s worthwhile for investors to compare the opportunity cost of the drag relative to the cost of other forms of downside protection.\r\n\r\n<strong>Taking a long term view</strong>\r\n\r\nRegardless of the downside exposure a recession brings, it’s ultimately just one event and a normal part of the business cycle. Many recessions will follow in the future and each down market will eventually recover. Patience is the key.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Vega Fund has now formally launched and is open to sophisticated and wholesale investors.

Trading conditions were again mild but we’re still seeing ample opportunities for capital growth. Our active risk positions generated a 4.35 per cent return with our hedging positions detracting the balance.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://vegacapital.net/2018/06/21/tariffswhy-part-2/\">As I’ve discussed several times on the blog</a> and <a href=\"https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/handling-the-downside-risk-from-trump-s-tariffs\">most recently in Livewire</a>, I continue to see that tariffs are the biggest risk posed to the world economy at this time. Disrupting global trade flows with has historically been a poor way to promote economic growth – it usually results in the opposite occurring.\r\n\r\nMany companies are already reporting supply chain issues despite most of the considered tariffs only being threats. I remain concerned about the macroeconomic impacts which could ensue should President Trump continue to follow through with this policy.\r\n\r\nOver the month, we became underweight options over the NASDAQ as we realised some profitable positions which were established back in April and May when technology stocks were under pressure.\r\n\r\nConcerns over tariffs drove mis-pricing amongst options over the S&amp;P500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indices. As such, our algorithm has moved capital into these areas.\r\n\r\nOur macroeconomic indicators are notably beginning to sour. It doesn’t appear quite time to go short yet...but we’re getting closer. Unforeseen events could push us back towards a more confident bullish stance, but only time will tell.\r\n\r\nThis will be the last time we provide an update on performance from the founder’s capital account. Since the Vega Fund is now open to investors, I think it’s likely that talking about two accounts will create confusion. From here on, I’ll post our monthly investor reports on the blog in place of these updates.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Vega Capital is a wealth manager for high net worth individual and financial institutions.

If you don’t understand that’s going to happen, then you’re not ready, you won’t do well in the markets”. </em>Today I’m going to discuss some ways in which investors can protect their portfolios from downside risk.\r\n\r\nWe employ almost all of these methods at The Vega Fund.\r\n\r\n<strong>Diversification</strong>\r\n\r\nInvestors can reduce downside exposure (particularly from idiosyncratic risk) by being diversified across individual stocks and sectors. This is particularly important for investors with little time to research industries and individual stocks since idiosyncratic risks are best monitored by professionals who can do so on a continuous basis.\r\n\r\nDuring a recession however, diversification amongst stocks is unlikely enough to protect from falls in prices. This is where diversification amongst negatively correlated asset classes can help.\r\n\r\n<strong>Negatively correlated assets</strong>\r\n\r\nAn asset having negative correlation with respect to stocks simply means that when the price of said stocks fall, the price for this asset will rise. One example of this is a put option which will increase in value as the underlying stock it’s written on falls in price.\r\n\r\nHowever you don’t necessarily need to pay for a put in order to have downside protection. An investor could sell a call option, effectively selling some upside in their investment to hedge some downside risk.\r\n\r\nOther alternatives involve buying a VIX future contract. Typically during a correction or recession, stock price volatility will spike. Since the VIX future contract is linked to stock price volatility (via the implied volatility of options), it will increase in value during a negative market event.\r\n\r\nBy introducing negatively correlated assets into our portfolio, we\'re effectively hedging said portfolio. We can improve the effectiveness of our hedging by increasing the number of hedges we hold as stock prices rise and reduce them as stock prices fall. Since hedges are typically cheaper in rising markets and more expensive in falling markets, we end up buying our hedges at a low price and selling them at a higher price. As such, we can actually both protect our portfolio and earn returns over time.\r\n\r\nIn the below we\'ve attempted to show this as an example. We start in period 1 with our portfolio - 2 units of stocks and 2 units of VIX.\r\n\r\nIn period 2, stock prices fall by 50 per cent and the VIX increases by 50 per cent. We hold our stocks and sell down 1 unit of VIX for a profit of 5.\r\n\r\nIn period 3, both the stock market and VIX normalise back to their original prices. We still get to keep 5 in profit from the prior market moves. The VIX position is also built back up to 2 units.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2751 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/vix-pic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"440\" height=\"221\" />\r\n\r\nThis is a simplified example but provides the intuition on how Vega usually manages downside risk.\r\n\r\n<strong>Holding cash</strong>\r\n\r\nHolding cash in our view is one of the least preferred options to mitigating downside risk. That said, we do hold a lot of cash in our portfolio (circa 50 per cent) but this is acting as reserve capital for our derivatives positions as opposed to a means of downside protection.\r\n\r\nThe issue with cash is that it’s guaranteed to under-perform over time relative to a portfolio of stocks or other risk assets. As such, it adds a continuous negative drag to a portfolio’s returns. Since recessions are often years apart, the opportunity cost of the drag is actually quite large.\r\n\r\nEven if the portfolio weightings of cash are adjusted over time based on stock valuations, cash may still be a drag on performance if stock prices rise despite appearing expensive.\r\n\r\nWe believe it’s worthwhile for investors to compare the opportunity cost of the drag relative to the cost of other forms of downside protection.\r\n\r\n<strong>Taking a long term view</strong>\r\n\r\nRegardless of the downside exposure a recession brings, it’s ultimately just one event and a normal part of the business cycle. Many recessions will follow in the future and each down market will eventually recover. Patience is the key.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Vega Fund has now formally launched and is open to sophisticated and wholesale investors.

We’re looking forward to fielding questions from investors about the markets, our portfolio and the business itself.</li>\r\n 	<li>I will also be meeting with Sarah Harding of WY Advice for her popular ‘Wealth Wednesdays’ segment in early August. We’ll post a copy of the video on the blog for readers as soon as it’s available.</li>\r\n 	<li>Finally, in addition to publishing weekly on this blog, we will also be publishing new regular content on Livewire.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nToday we’re providing a brief update on some trading and the portfolio\'s positioning. Last week we rolled part of the portfolio which held some QQQ index puts opened back in May and redeployed capital by writing SPY index puts.\r\n\r\nThe Vega fund has two conditions in its algorithm which allow for rolling,\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Roll any option with less than 6 months to maturity; or</li>\r\n 	<li>Roll any option whose premium has collapsed significantly in value such that there are better opportunities elsewhere.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nFor the QQQ index puts, we received $787 per contract and bought them back for $240 per contract. We’ve then rolled into some 265 strike December 2019 puts on the SPY index for $1,344 per contract. These appear 5 per cent mispriced and offer a total 23.5 per cent per annum return on capital.\r\n\r\nSince inception our fund has been bullish on the market and this has paid off. Macroeconomic indicators are green and so is momentum hence we’re still comfortable with our long market exposure. We do however have an array of hedges in place going into August to take advantage of any shocks from tariffs or the US reporting season.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Vega Fund has now formally launched and is open to sophisticated and wholesale investors.

Decisions based on information contained on this Website are the sole responsibility of the visitor whom we would encourage to seek relevant advice from a licenced professional.</em>\r\n\r\nLast week I wrote a blog about Vega’s hedging algorithm – the response was great and I appreciated the positive feedback a lot.\r\n\r\nSince investors are keen to learn more about how Vega can deliver downside protection, I thought it would be valuable to show a simulation of our strategy over the GFC during 2008. This is notably where Vega has the potential to really shine.\r\n\r\nLet’s start by looking at the SPY. The index began 2008 at circa 145 and capitulated 38.6 per cent over the year to below 89. Annualised volatility was 41.3 per cent for this period. This was one of the worst markets for investors since the Great Depression.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2692 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hedge-pic-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"447\" height=\"270\" />\r\n\r\nAnd admittedly, if it weren’t for the actions of The Federal Reserve, The US Treasury and many members of the exiting Bush Administration and entering Obama Administration, it might well have been the Second Great Depression. I always credit Ben Bernanke, Timothy Geithner, Hank Paulson and President Barrack Obama in particular for their huge roles in stabilising the Global Financial System at this time.\r\n\r\nSo let’s see how Vega would have performed over this period using SPY put options with a duration of 6 to 12 months.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2693 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hedge-pic-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"467\" height=\"282\" />\r\n\r\nThe returns are clearly large...so what happened? In the simulation, Vega during 2007 had been long market exposure through writing put options across various market indices. By late in 2007, it had liquidated all its positions into cash. In late April of of 2008, it began buying puts and also entered into some hedges.\r\n\r\nBy year end, the simulation results show that Vega would have generated a 142 per cent return on capital employed. Versus the index, this represents circa 180 percentage points of out-performance. Annualised volatility was rather high at 55 per cent, however this is a small price to pay for such a high return. In addition, the strategy was rather inefficient between October and December and had some rough draw-downs, although not as bad as what the SPY would have experienced over the year.\r\n\r\nOverall, if this were the result of our portfolio over this timeframe, we’d be quite pleased. <strong>But please note a few important points to consider upon reviewing these performance numbers.</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>The simulation is limited in nature. We’ve only run it on SPY puts of a certain duration at a single strike for the purposes of a blog. Other positions on other assets and strike prices may have generated lesser returns.</li>\r\n 	<li>The simulation was done on a portfolio of long SPY put options. In future we’ll most likely have the algorithm use <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearputspread.asp\">bear put spreads</a> to achieve high returns but with lower downside risk to reduce the impact if our models were to be wrong.</li>\r\n 	<li>Past performance does not equal a promise of future returns. The GFC was a very volatile event and in the simulation Vega was able to capture the downside well. Yet future crises may be less severe which would obviously mean the potential for returns is lesser.</li>\r\n 	<li>Events like this don’t occur every year. We expect Vega to do well but certainly not earn more than 100 per cent annually.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur mandate at Vega Capital is to invest our client’s investment in such a way as to generate high returns during both expansions and contractions in the economy and financial markets.

We also broke this number down into returns from our active risk positions (+14 per cent) and our hedging book (-8.3 per cent).\r\n\r\nNaturally, investors may wonder why hedging is required when it’s clearly so costly. After all, if we didn’t hedge, we could deliver much higher returns. But this is only true if nothing goes wrong. The benefit of hedging occurs when things do go wrong.\r\n\r\nSo today we’re going to run some simulations to see the benefit of Vega’s hedging algorithm.\r\n\r\nLet’s run the Vega strategy on some historical data using just SPY puts with a duration of 12 to 18 months. We’re firstly not going to hedge in order to see how volatile the portfolio’s performance gets and emphasise the value of hedging.\r\n\r\nThe period we’re going to test over is the first half of FY11. Over this period, the US lost its AAA credit rating which caused a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(2011)\">minor panic in the markets</a>.\r\n\r\nTo start, here’s how the index did over that period.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2674 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hedge-pic-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"481\" height=\"289\" />\r\n\r\nAs above, the SPY declined by 6.3 per cent. At its worst it was down 18.8 per cent. Annualised volatility was 30 per cent – clearly a rough patch.\r\n\r\nVega’s portfolio at this time would have been long market exposure due to the strengthening economy and expensive put option prices. Clearly with the index falling from 135 to 110, a portfolio of written puts is going to fare quite badly but this is what Vega would have had.\r\n\r\nSo let’s look at how Vega performed <strong>without</strong> the hedging algorithm.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2675 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hedge-pic-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"481\" height=\"289\" />\r\n\r\nIn short – not well. The strategy lost 6.1 per cent for the half, what was worse however was the &gt; 40 per cent drawdown incurred. Annualised volatility for the period was a gut wrenching 77 per cent. Quite clearly, this is not an experience we would hope to incur in the Vega portfolio.\r\n\r\nThe index lost 6.3 per cent so technically the strategy outperformed. However at Vega we don’t consider a negative return as outperformance – even if it beats the index.\r\n\r\nNow let’s <strong>add back in</strong> the hedging algorithm and see how Vega performs.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2677 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hedge-pic-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"481\" height=\"289\" />\r\n\r\nWhat a difference! By using the hedging book, the strategy is able to hold on during the market collapse and then also capture the upside from the recovery. There’s still a draw-down of 16.4 per cent and elevated volatility of 43 per cent (annualised) however Vega returned 21.7 per cent over the period – outperforming by 28 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe value of hedging is hence very apparent. Vega can generate strong returns in bull markets even if hedging is expensive and this is a good trade off to ensure it can generate returns in weaker markets.\r\n\r\nThe Vega Fund has now formally launched and is open to sophisticated and wholesale investors.

Our active risk positions generated a 14 per cent return and hedging positions detracted 8.3 per cent – netting 5.7 per cent.\r\n\r\nSince we’re finishing a quarter, it’s worth a brief review of what we’re observing in the US economy and comment on how Vega is positioning itself.\r\n\r\nWe’ll first start on tariffs. For those just catching up – we previously blogged about tariffs <a href=\"https://vegacapital.net/2018/06/21/tariffswhy-part-2/\">here</a>. These are a concern since if President Trump were to follow through on his threats to further expand tariffs to include all Chinese exports, this significantly increases the probability that the US will go into a recession.\r\n\r\nAs this occurs, the Vega Fund will likely begin to reposition itself from being bullish to bearish. It’s apparent that in such a circumstance that neither the US Government nor the Federal Reserve will have the firepower necessary to combat such an issue with stimulus. Further, prices for stocks appear high and given that the authorities have little in reserve should something go wrong, the downside is likely quite large.\r\n\r\nThis presents a very rare opportunity for the Vega Fund to generate outsized returns.  We can’t say with certainty that it will occur – only that our algorithms will be monitoring closely.\r\n\r\nNot all we’re seeing is bad news and notably the fund has still been positioned long (with hedges in place). Over the last quarter, US employment numbers have been not been stronger for over 16 years.\r\n\r\nThe unemployment rate in June increased to 4.0 per cent from 3.8 per cent back in May as a result of a 600,000 increase in the number of citizens seeking work. It will be interesting to see how they fair over the next month.\r\n\r\nInterest rates still appear cyclically low despite having quite a hawkish Federal Reserve board. As many have observed, if we were to quote an unemployment rate of 4.0 per cent, the S&amp;P500 at record highs, inflation at 2.8 per cent, where would we expect interest rates? Certainly higher than 2 per cent....\r\n\r\nIn 2015, 2016 and 2017 it was understandable that the Fed wouldn’t raise rates too quickly because inflation was tempered. However now it has to temper raising so as not to elevate systemic risks given how much debt has been issued by corporates.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2649 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pic-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"352\" />\r\n\r\nTempering would also be required should tariffs begin to have a negative impact on economic growth. As such, it could still be a while before we reach a more normal interest rate environment.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Vega Fund has now formally launched and is open to sophisticated and wholesale investors.

Let’s start off today’s blog by putting some numbers around the topic.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/historical/gands.pdf\">According to Census.gov</a>, US imported goods and services were valued at $2.9 trillion in 2017. China exports to the US were circa $500 billion hence meaning that Chinese exports comprised 17 per cent of US imports – clearly not a small number.\r\n\r\nUS exports of goods and services to China are valued at $120/$130 billion resulting in a trade deficit of approximately $380 billion in favour of China.\r\n\r\nEarlier last week, the Trump Administration put forth a plan to place tariffs across $46.2b of Chinese exports to the US. China responded with its own tariffs across $49.8b of US exports to which President Trump retaliated with a plan for tariffs accross an additional $200b goods and services as well the threat of another $200b if they retaliated again.\r\n\r\nThe below info-graphic (compiled by Chad P Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics) gives us an idea about what exports are affected prior to Trumps escalation of $200b of tariffed Chinese exports.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2630\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pic-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"284\" height=\"369\" /> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2631\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pic-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"306\" height=\"369\" />\r\n\r\nSummed up, the Presidents threats now comprise circa 90 per cent of China’s exports to the US - approximately 15.5 per cent of total US imports.\r\n\r\nAs we discussed in our <a href=\"https://vegacapital.net/2018/06/14/tariffs-why/\">previous blog</a>, the impact is not just on the producers of the tariff protected goods – it’s on all the downstream producers/services relying on that good. Hence the cost of these tariffs can be very widespread. In addition, most economists would agree that the costs of a tariff outweigh the benefits gained by the protected goods and services.\r\n\r\nAdd on top of this the fact that the President is also pushing tariffs onto Mexico, Canada and the European Union….who are in turn retaliating with their own tariffs over many billions of US exports.\r\n\r\nThe economic benefits which accrue to nations as a result of free trade are quite well known – hence all these actions seem very irrational and many suspect that this is less of a real threat by the President and is more posturing. Time will tell.\r\n\r\nChina of course can’t retaliate with its own tariff of $200b because the US isn\'t exporting that much to them. But it can attempt to make the US\' agenda in Asia more complicated. North Korea or The South China Sea would seem the obvious choices from that angle. It doesn’t appear likely however that China will be able to back down since the President has given them no face-saving way of accomplishing this feat.\r\n\r\nThe President however can back down and whilst many believe that that he’s too stubborn for this, I’m less sure. President Trump often has a more…fluid approach to policy making and we might be having a very different conversation by next month (or next week).\r\n\r\nThe most sensible option at this point would be for China and the US to meet, curb tensions and have both sides walk away declaring victory. However unlikely this scenario seems at this hour, its realisation wouldn’t surprise me.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if these issues continue to escalate, (in my own view) it just might be enough to impair the economic growth of the US over the short to medium term which would likely have a negative impact on financial markets.\r\n\r\nThe Vega portfolio doesn’t operate via ‘views’ however – as it stands the Vega economic algorithms are bullish, hence so is the portfolio and despite stock markets falling over the past couple of days, the portfolio is holding up quite well via it\'s hedging book. Our algorithms continue to monitor economic data and will make any required changes accordingly.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, if economic growth does become impaired over the medium term, our back tests have shown that such an occurrence is one in which the Vega portfolio can perform exceptionally well.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Vega Capital is a Corporate Authorised Representative (No. 001264482) of Alpha Securities Pty Ltd (ACN 124 327 064) AFS Licence No. 330757.</em>', 'Tariffs…Why?

His view is that other countries are engaging in unfair trading practices which impact Americans in an adverse way.\r\n\r\nAnd the truth is that yes – competition from cheaper resources or labour from overseas does impact some workers negatively. This is not something we can dismiss because it’s real people, not just statistics that we’re talking about.\r\n\r\nHowever when formulating policy, there’s no reason not to engage in practices which vastly improve the quality of life outcomes for the majority of the populous. Programs and policies can be devised and funded to support the less fortunate however it’s up to the government to ensure that they’re executed well.\r\n\r\nNow what benefits am I talking about? Well there are many but I want to draw attention to just one – wealth. Consider the last several hundred years since the beginning of the industrial revolution. What is noticeable is the vast improvement in the wealth state of all citizens. It’s been the greatest upheaval of citizens from poverty to prosperity that has ever occurred in human history.\r\n\r\nThrough technology and practices, we’ve enable our society to become infinitely more productive i.e. producing more goods &amp; services and hence enjoy a higher quality of life.\r\n\r\nTariffs are a reversal of that trend – it\'s taking value from both consumers and producers by artificially inflating the price of goods and services and transferring that value to the government. The consumer budget becomes more stretched, producers are less incentivised to compete (especially tariff protected producers) and there’s less money left for innovation and product/service improvements.\r\n\r\nThis is even before we consider the adverse effects of the government essentially picking winners and losers in the market place.\r\n\r\nThe costs of a tariff are not equally spread however – obviously if you are a tariff protected producer then you don’t have a cost – in fact you get a benefit. However consumers of imported products in competition with the local producers obviously lose. In addition, jobs which depend on prior low prices of the tariff protected product lose out and this can be a much larger population than of those said tariff was originally trying to protect.\r\n\r\nFor example, whilst steel tariff may benefit steel producers, they hurt car manufacturers and other businesses which do better with low steel prices. Hence whilst you might save some jobs within the steel producing industries, you lose jobs elsewhere which damages the economy on a net basis.\r\n\r\nThe derivative effect of tariffs of course is that other countries retaliate which compounds the problem (and which is now occurring). You end up in a tit-for-tat of tariff trading which benefits a few at the expense of the many. It’s a wealth reducing set of circumstances which would have negative outcomes for both economies and markets.\r\n\r\nAt Vega, we don’t believe that this is something which is likely to result in hugely adverse consequences for the market unless President Trump makes a habit of such measures – unfortunately there is a small probability that he may well do.\r\n\r\nInvestors should know however that if a tariff war were to begin to impact the US economy, our algorithms which monitor this data will act - aiming to both minimise the downside risk and maximise the upside potential.\r\n\r\nThe Vega Fund will be formally opened on the 1<sup>st</sup> of July 2018 to sophisticated and wholesale investors. Our information memorandum and application forms will be posted on the website shortly.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in becoming a foundation investor of the Vega Fund, please contact us at the link above.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Vega Capital is a Corporate Authorised Representative (No. 001264482) of Alpha Securities Pty Ltd (ACN 124 327 064) AFS Licence No. 330757.</em>', 'Tariffs….why?', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '2587-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-08-23 11:21:51', '2018-08-23 11:21:51', '', 2587, 'http://vegacapital.net/new/uncategorized/2587-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The reason was market concerns around Italy’s new right wing government – the Five Star party and how it may effect Italy’s finances as well as its standing or even membership of the European Bloc. Some poor results from a couple of US companies didn\'t help either.\r\n\r\nAs of the time of writing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.7 per cent and yet the Vega portfolio was down only 0.25 per cent as a result of our hedges kicking in. It’s actually surprising that such news has had any market impact given that none of this is new information. Further, such events are insignificant in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\nYet - since the Vega Fund is in its early stage, I believe it’s worth us commenting on such a topic to explain how the algorithm deals with these issues (which occur commonly) and why our philosophy considers these events as simply noise.\r\n\r\nThere are two main concerns, the first is that Italy will default on its public debt. The second is that Italy will leave the Bloc.\r\n\r\nFirstly the latter raises the risk of the former since it shows that the government is willing to engage in radical measures to achieve its goals. Italy will likely pay higher interest rates on future debt issues outside of the Bloc than inside it which increases default prospects. But remember, a big funder of the Italian debt is Italian citizens – which would mean that Italy essentially defaults on itself – an odd conundrum.\r\n\r\nItaly has an economy operating with debt levels of more than 130 per cent of GDP. This makes life difficult because if interest rates are say 3 per cent, it’s interest bill per annum is higher than GDP growth and to escape from this requires large cuts in spending (austerity) – of which we know creates a weak/recessionary economy and makes the prospect of growth hard to achieve.\r\n\r\nTo bring this back to Vega’s algorithm and how it handles such events, at this stage we would need to see it create a significant amount of trade destabilisation which then precipitates into a more broad-based global economic contraction and unemployment.\r\n\r\nSince today’s events are not likely to impact these variables so significantly, we can see why Vega’s algorithm would largely ignore it - hence our portfolio is still long market exposure.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to what the back test results showed when Greece was in the news – a lot of noise, but little real risk.', 'The Eurozone is back in the news', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '2174-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-08-23 11:24:36', '2018-08-23 11:24:36', '', 2174, 'http://vegacapital.net/new/uncategorized/2174-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The objectives of a central bank may differ somewhat between countries but they generally have a similar approach – rising inflation is contained with higher interest rates and vice versa.\n\nInflation typically occurs when economies are going a little too well (I’ve clarified with ‘typically’ to exclude events such as Germany’s hyperinflation of the 1920’s and the like). For example, as an economy reaches output capacity it leads to a tighter labour market which spurs wage increases and then more spending/borrowing. Over time, inflation results.\n\nNow let’s introduce the stock market. A simple valuation model for stocks is the Gordon Growth Model which can be expressed as follows.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2140 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Econ-pic-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"432\" height=\"56\" />\n\nThe rate of discount is key here because it’s the sum of (i) the risk free rate (set by the central bank) and (ii) the risk premium. Hence if the central bank raises rates, this places downside pressure on the valuation that the stock market can achieve. Indeed, the Fed has been raising rates and is expected to continue to do so.\n\nSo should we be worried about lower stock prices in the future ? Well let’s not forget earnings and earnings growth. As noted prior, for interest rates to rise we need excess inflation as a result of an economy which is beginning to overheat. What would we expect in such an environment? Higher earnings. This puts upward pressure on valuations which can offset the downward pressure of interest rates.\n\n(There are exceptions to this theory but let’s stick to the standard model).\n\nThis is why despite the uptick in fed rates over the 2004-2008 period, the stock market kept climbing.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2141 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Econ-pic-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"481\" height=\"289\" />\n\nNegative returns only result when the economy’s debt burden becomes too heavy, which then requires consumers to cuts spending to pay back their debts (a deleveraging).

The objectives of a central bank may differ somewhat between countries but they generally have a similar approach – rising inflation is contained with higher interest rates and vice versa.\r\n\r\nInflation typically occurs when economies are going a little too well (I’ve clarified with ‘typically’ to exclude events such as Germany’s hyperinflation of the 1920’s and the like). For example, as an economy reaches output capacity it leads to a tighter labour market which spurs wage increases and then more spending/borrowing. Over time, inflation results.\r\n\r\nNow let’s introduce the stock market. A simple valuation model for stocks is the Gordon Growth Model which can be expressed as follows.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2140 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Econ-pic-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"432\" height=\"56\" />\r\n\r\nThe rate of discount is key here because it’s the sum of (i) the risk free rate (set by the central bank) and (ii) the risk premium. Hence if the central bank raises rates, this places downside pressure on the valuation that the stock market can achieve. Indeed, the Fed has been raising rates and is expected to continue to do so.\r\n\r\nSo should we be worried about lower stock prices in the future ? Well let’s not forget earnings and earnings growth. As noted prior, for interest rates to rise we need excess inflation as a result of an economy which is beginning to overheat. What would we expect in such an environment? Higher earnings. This puts upward pressure on valuations which can offset the downward pressure of interest rates.\r\n\r\n(There are exceptions to this theory but let’s stick to the standard model).\r\n\r\nThis is why despite the uptick in fed rates over the 2004-2008 period, the stock market kept climbing.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2141 aligncenter\" src=\"https://vegacapital.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Econ-pic-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"481\" height=\"289\" />\r\n\r\nNegative returns only result when the economy’s debt burden becomes too heavy, which then requires consumers to cuts spending to pay back their debts (a deleveraging). And which then results in lower income for others (a recession begins).\r\n\r\nSo let\'s bring this framework back to what we\'re seeing in the US economy;\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/15/feds-kaplan-sees-us-inflation-rising-but-not-running-away.html\">The Fed see’s inflation as rising but not an issue</a>.

The hedging book was moderated slightly as our risk algorithms became marginally less cautious. Overall this was an uneventful month.\r\n\r\nThe Vega Fund is a long term strategy. 3.3 per cent for the first month is certainly pleasing, but negligible relative to performance over the long term.\r\n\r\nWe are currently in the final stages of agreements for administration, AFSL and other standard fund requirements.

Take a coin and a chessboard. This coin fits perfectly within a square on the chessboard. Now if you dropped the coin onto the chessboard, what is the likelihood that the coin covers the corner of four chessboard squares?\r\n\r\nNow intuitively this likelihood would seem to be rather small or large (depending on who you ask). But actually <a href=\"https://www.braingle.com/brainteasers/teaser.php?op=2&amp;id=43993&amp;comm=0\">if you do the math</a>, there’s almost a fair chance of this occurring (47.6 per cent).\r\n\r\nHumans intuitively are poor judges of probability. The economist Robert Shiller regularly takes a survey of investor’s thoughts on the market. One question he asks is for the participants to judge the probability of a catastrophic market crash within the next six months. Now statistically, the likelihood of such an event is about 1 per cent, however over the last 25 years, participants have assigned a 19 per cent mean probability to such an event.\r\n\r\nSo why is this the case? To be fair, probabilities are hard to account for in the market for many reasons.\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Market participants are subject to bias – informational, emotional and behavioural.</li>\r\n 	<li>There is not always a standardised method to estimate probability.</li>\r\n 	<li>We are subject to only using a subset of all known information. And new information is coming in all the time.</li>\r\n 	<li>Financial markets are a complex system – the way in which it behaves varies over time.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nLet’s now consider an example a friend asked for my advice on recently and then discuss the approach that Vega would use.\r\n\r\nLet’s say we’re considering buying a security. It is believed that the security will be worth $5.00 if event X occurs, $5.20 if event Y occurs and $3.50 if neither of the two occur (call this event Z). The market mostly believes X will occur and so the security is currently trading for $4.70.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the market is most probably right (call it 65 per cent chance) but also believed that Y could occur (25 per cent chance). Event Z is viewed as most unlikely although possible (10 per cent chance). The source of these probability estimates is investor\'s experience in the market over time.\r\n\r\nBased on this information, what should we do? Most investors will attempt to calculate the expected profit from each scenario and find the sum total. In this case, the expected profit from such a transaction is 20 cents.\r\n\r\nWe’re ignoring the time component of this trade – obviously if it were to take 1 month, it’s more favourable than if it were to take 1 year. Hence if the duration were short, it might be considered a worthwhile investment. What I want to focus on though is two things.\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Unlike in our coin example, we have no reliable way to demonstrate that the probability estimates are accurate. Probabilities based on investor\'s experience in the market (as we can see from Shiller\'s example) can be very wrong.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>The probability estimates are hence based on nothing more than bias and perception. </strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nNow if the upside cases were to emerge, this matters less - we\'ve made money. But what if the $3.50 case emerged? We don’t wish to make the same mistake that Shiller’s survey participants did in overestimating the risk - but since <strong>we don’t actually know</strong> whether the probability is 1 per cent or 50 per cent or even roughly what it is, it makes sense to consider the downside risk more stringently.\r\n\r\nWe’re also ignoring the fact that making a bet based on probabilities for a scenario which has only 1 step has issues. Whilst the probability of realising the $5.20 case may be 65 per cent, in reality, it either happens or it doesn’t. Many trials are required to make theory a reality.\r\n\r\nVega’s approach would be to pass on such an opportunity - this is unless the duration were sufficiently short, some downside risk could be hedged away and we could more reliably assess the probable outcomes through statistical and economic analysis. Such an approach is the driving force behind Vega’s stellar back test results. As it turns out, being humble pays dividends.\r\n\r\nIn the coming weeks, we’ll be releasing details of our 25 year back test which demonstrates Vega’s strong returns over many bull and bear markets.\r\n\r\n<!-- <fw_preview_session>1525350087701</fw_preview_session> -->', 'How Vega uses probability to outperform', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '2146-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-08-23 11:27:50', '2018-08-23 11:27:50', '', 2146, 'http://vegacapital.net/new/uncategorized/2146-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

At the time these options had an inflated premium of $6 (Vega entered at $6.30) as technology stocks came under pressure amid the Facebook inquiry, the crash of an autonomous car and concerns that governments would regulate companies such as Facebook and Google more stringently.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy at the Vega Fund is that these events are largely noise. Looking longer term, most firms (not all) which dominate market indices have strong competitive positions and a long run of profitability ahead of them whether regulated or not….One must remember that the Tobacco industry enjoyed many a profitable year post heavy regulation – a counter-intuitive fact!\r\n\r\nHowever a July 2018 put is not a long term bet - it’s clearly short term. The underlying stock index should behave largely randomly within this time-frame hence we employed statistics combined with Vega’s macroeconomic analysis to assess the opportunity and risk. The outcome of this was that the option which was yielding a 25 per cent return to July if priced fairly should have offered only 15 per cent or less (embedded alpha of 10 per cent). In addition, whilst a financial market shock was possible, it was also statically unlikely. Hence combined with some hedges against disaster and as one of many positions in the portfolio, Vega wrote the put.\r\n\r\nSaid put is now trading for around $3.20 and in our view isn’t such a compelling opportunity anymore. The potential returns have fallen considerably and the risks are changing. As options approach maturity, they become more sensitive to market shocks relative to that of options which have more time until expiration. The reason is that if there is a sudden drop in the market, the near term option may go in-the-money and not have ample time for the market price to correct before expiration.\r\n\r\nHowever new opportunities have arisen elsewhere – particularly in the SPY (S&amp;P500 SPDR mini) and we have redeployed capital accordingly.\r\n\r\nVega last week wrote a put option on March 2019 SPY 260 puts for $13.40 (last price was $13.90 so we’re down slightly). We received $1,340 per put and put up around $4,400 in margin per put. The return on capital employed at the time was around 30 per cent with embedded alpha of 5 per cent (at fair value, the option should have only been offering a 25 per cent return).\r\n\r\nOur outlook on the SPY is neutral to positive and this is required for a written put position to yield us a return. The economy in our view is strong (see <a href=\"http://vegacapital.net/2018/04/08/how-does-vega-see-the-us-economic-cycle/\">here</a>), price momentum has weakened (not conclusively) and volatility clustering post the February correction has abated. Now this opportunity is nowhere as good as the QQQ trade prior however with a 30 per cent potential return on capital employed it was a welcome addition to the portfolio.\r\n\r\nIt’s important we clarify however that this trade on the SPY has not been made in isolation, it\'s one part of a much larger portfolio and has been made in conjunction with various hedges. <strong>Hence we’re not advising clients or readers to make the same trade</strong>.

So does this mean we’ve become suddenly bearish on the US economy?\r\n\r\nIn short <strong>no</strong>. To answer this question, we must understand how Vega views cash as an investment. Cash as observed by Warren Buffet is one of the poorest investments available – it by default provides no real capital growth over time and hence to hold significant quantities of cash is an inefficient use of capital.\r\n\r\nTypically, many investors will hold a portion of their portfolio in cash – waiting for an opportunistic entry into an investment or because there doesn’t appear to be ample investment opportunities in the market. Yet Vega is not finding investment opportunities to be scarce – quite the contrary, there are many.\r\n\r\nVega is holding 50 per cent of its portfolio in cash for several reasons.\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>The investments in the portfolio have already very high payoffs, so even with substantial levels of cash, the portfolio has been constructed with a high probability of out-performance. Hence the portfolio does not need to take on more risk than it already is.</li>\r\n 	<li>Vega will always hold ample reserves of cash in order to handle any short term events where volatility is elevated. It’s notable that due to the high volatility of the options market, new opportunities arise at a higher frequency than that of the stock market.</li>\r\n 	<li>There is the potential for even better opportunities to arise which require higher levels of margin capital – the Vega Fund is hence well positioned to take advantage of these events.</li>\r\n 	<li>There is little need to go over-weight on risk when the market is fairly mature and economic/geopolitical risks are rising.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nHence we have a solid case for holding significant quantities of cash. We may hold more or less in the future, but that depends on what opportunities are out there and economic risk levels.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, the implied return of Vega’s cash reserves is more than just interest earned, it\'s allows us to easily position into better opportunities and hold the portfolio through volatile periods. In addition, the Vega portfolio has ample exposure and embedded alpha sufficient to generate market beating levels of performance for our clients.\r\n\r\nThe Vega fund will be open to sophisticated investors <strong>by invitation</strong> from the 1st of July 2018.\r\n\r\n<!-- <fw_preview_session>1523848878574</fw_preview_session> -->', 'Vega holds 50 per cent cash….are we bearish?', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '2144-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-08-23 11:30:31', '2018-08-23 11:30:31', '', 2144, 'http://vegacapital.net/new/uncategorized/2144-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Now if this were a simple process then everyone would be doing it but since it’s quite complicated, we’re going to outlay a little of our thinking on the matter.\r\n\r\nCycles typically have four parts, an expansion, a peak, a recession and a recovery. To start we can make some fairly obvious observations about the US economy.\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>It doesn’t appear to be in recession.</li>\r\n 	<li>It has experienced a recovery post the contraction of 2009.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich leaves us to wonder whether the current economy is in an expansionary phase or has peaked. It would be difficult to determine the answer with 100 per cent certainty so we’ll speak in terms of probabilities.\r\n\r\nIf you’re a frequent reader of Howard Mark’s literature you’ll have read his January memo to clients (<a href=\"https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/latest-thinking.pdf\">link</a>). Marks\' makes some pertinent economic observations:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><em>The U.S. economy is chugging along, and the recovery that started in 2009 has become one of the longest in history (103 months old at this point). The rest of the world’s economies are joining in for that rare thing, worldwide growth. Most economies seem to be gaining rather than losing steam, and they don’t appear likely to run out of it anytime soon.”</em></li>\r\n 	<li><em>Since the economic recovery hasn’t been marked by excesses to the upside, when a recession eventually does occur, it doesn’t have to be extreme. In short, no boom, no bust.</em></li>\r\n 	<li><em>The unemployment rate is down to 4.1%, nearly the lowest level in 60 years, meaning we’re nearing “full employment” (albeit with an unusually low percentage of adults participating in the workforce). </em></li>\r\n 	<li><em>The low levels of inflation worldwide mean central bankers needn’t rush to raise interest rates to restrain it. There’s no obvious reason to predict hyperinflation. Thus the near-term rise in interest rates – while probable – can be expected to be gradual and limited in scope.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo in short the economy appears to be growing and economic indicators are positive. Given this as well as Vega’s algorithm based economic analysis, we would estimate that the likelihood that US is still expanding is perhaps 60/70% and the likelihood of a peak 30/40% - perhaps the latter more recently elevated by the possibility of a trade war between the US and China - but let’s not get carried away.\r\n\r\nThe latest economic data point for the US economy has been non-farm payrolls and the unemployment rate which came out Friday at 4.1% (consensus expectations was 4.0%). Since the economy is close to full employment, the natural process would be for wages from here to increase and lead to later inflation and some tempering via interest rates, but this is a gradual process as Marks noted.\r\n\r\nSo how is Vega’s option portfolio positioned for this environment given this view? Like Marks, we’re cautiously optimistic. The Vega portfolio is tilted towards expecting an inflation in stock market prices over the medium term. Economic risk however is increasing.\r\n\r\nOur hedging book is well placed to withstand any unforeseeable market volatility and we’re pleased with the margin of safety between market prices and the valuation of our portfolio. Given another quote from the memo, this seems prudent.\r\n\r\n<em>“Most valuation parameters are either the richest ever (Buffett ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP, price-to-sales ratio, the VIX, bond yields, private equity transaction multiples, real estate capitalisation ratios) or among the highest in history (p/e ratios, Shiller cycle-adjusted p/e ratio).”</em><!-- <fw_preview_session>1523192429084</fw_preview_session> -->', 'How does Vega see the US economic cycle?', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '2143-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-08-23 11:31:14', '2018-08-23 11:31:14', '', 2143, 'http://vegacapital.net/new/uncategorized/2143-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This is actually a necessity. To illustrate, let\'s consider the following example.\r\n\r\nThe Vega fund recently wrote an option on the QQQ (NASDAQ mini index) for $600 per contract that has 113 days to expiry with a strike of 150. The QQQ at the time was trading at about 157 so we have somewhat of a buffer before the strike. We\'re required to put up about $2400 in margin so our return is 25% for 113 days. By inspection, we can see that before we begin to take a loss, the QQQ would need to fall from 157 to below 144 (9%) by July which is not impossible but is statistically unlikely. Since the probability of a loss is unlikely, the probability of profit by reflection is likely.\r\n\r\nI\'m sure you can see where I\'m going with this - for a likely as well as high return over such a short period, the writer of this contract must be willing to accept a large loss if the QQQ falls a lot. Otherwise, there\'s nothing in it for the buyer of the contract and the trade won\'t occur. As custodians of our clients capital, this presents downside risk which we must manage.\r\n\r\nWe first note that whilst the option will pay us a 25% return, Vega\'s proprietary model tells us that the \'fair\' return should only be 15% (a margin of safety of 10%). This means that option buyers are craving security so much that they\'re willing to pay over the fair price for it - a happy coincidence as we\'re willing to sell overpriced options. Hence the contract isn\'t really fair - we have a mathematical edge from the start. This doesn\'t mean that we can\'t take a loss on this particular trade (it\'s just that we have a bigger buffer for losses than we theoretically should have).\r\n\r\nVega\'s algorithm will only ever enter into mis-priced securities which adds to both downside protection and investor returns over time.\r\n\r\nWe can further reduce the potential for a large loss by only selling option premium in less risky economic times whilst moving to cash or buying protection during risky times. As many of those reading will know, The Vega Fund has a set of algorithms which determine how risky the economy and financial markets are. Currently the algorithms are telling us that the risk of a big loss is low (but such a view is subject to continuous monitoring so please, don\'t take this as a recommendation). In doing this, we further skew the odds and returns in favour of our investors.\r\n\r\nFinally, in conjunction to Vega\'s portfolio, we run a separate portfolio which hedges against sudden unforeseeable market drops - especially useful for this particular investment.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, due to lucrative option premiums and a strong economic environment Vega is currently writing options over many broad based market indices but is then also taking on risk which must be managed. Vega manages portfolio risk against the broader economic/financial environment, hedging excess risk and only entering into contracts with a good margin of safety.\r\n\r\nThe Vega fund will be open to sophisticated investors <strong>by invitation</strong> from the 1st of July 2018.', 'How Vega minimises downside risk', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '1205-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-08-23 11:32:19', '2018-08-23 11:32:19', '', 1205, 'http://vegacapital.net/new/uncategorized/1205-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We analyse the controversial cryptocurrency.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nMemo to: Vega Capital clients\r\nFrom: Scott Shuttleworth\r\nSubject: Is bitcoin a bubble?\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<em>Neither the information, nor any opinion, contained on this Website constitutes a solicitation or offer by Vega Capital Pty Ltd (“Vega Capital”) or its affiliates to buy or sell any securities, futures, options or other financial instruments. Decisions based on information contained on this Website are the sole responsibility of the visitor whom we would encourage to seek relevant advice from a licenced professional.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>A while ago I was asked by a colleague in the industry to provide some brief views on Bitcoin and whether it was a bubble. The below was my response.</em>\r\n\r\nIn short, my view is that bitcoin has not reached a sufficient price to be classified as a bubble. Bubbles are typically defined as an unsustainable increase in the price of some asset well beyond any reasonable approximation of its underlying value. In order to consider whether bitcoin is a bubble or not, we would require some approximation of what its value is as well as some reasoning as to why the current price is unsustainable.\r\n\r\nBitcoin\'s primary function is as an anonymous unit of exchange, i.e. it can be used to perform some online transactions anonymously.  Yet it has problems in that it\'s rarely accepted by mainstream merchants (Expedia.com does for example but this is more the exceptional than the rule).\r\n\r\nIf we were to assume that Bitcoin eventually accrues the critical mass to be a useful unit of exchange (given its recent listing as a future contract on the CME, this may not be an unfair assumption) then we can more easily estimate its value. Global GDP according to the CIA world fact book was $U78.3 trillion in 2014 and it\'s estimated that trade via the black market is circa 20% of world GDP. If we were to assume a mere 10% of this market moves to bitcoin, the 21 million bitcoins (in <u>future</u> existence) would have a transaction value of circa $U1.56 trillion.\r\n\r\nGiven that each bitcoin in the above market estimate is utilised for a transaction several times, we must also adjust our estimates via the velocity of money. A study by ARK Investment Management and Coinbase suggested that circa half of the user base holds bitcoins as an investment (rather than as a unit of exchange). The money velocity of M1 in the US is currently about 5.5x so we adjust the transaction value by 11x (5.5x/.50) rendering a final valuation of circa $U6,780 per bitcoin.\r\n\r\nBased on bitcoin\'s latest price ($U6,900) it appears fair value...yet would 30% of the black market converting to bitcoin be unreasonable? Perhaps not. Whilst we have not taken into account any factor for the time value of monies invested, my view is that bitcoin does not appear to have reached a sufficient price as to satisfy the conditions for being a bubble.\r\n\r\nHowever those with a practical mind will immediately see the gaping hole in this argument - it assumes that bitcoin <strong>is</strong> the cryptocurrency of choice for the black market. Yet why should this be? As noted in an article by Reuters (<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-bitcoin/bitcoins-murkier-rivals-line-up-to-displace-it-as-cybercriminals-favourite-idUSKCN18E2F1\">link here</a>) <em>“If it was me, I would want people to use bitcoin all day, because you can trace it,” said Luke Wilson, vice president for law enforcement at Elliptic, a London-based security firm that tracks illicit bitcoin transactions and that counts the U.S. Federal Bureau for Investigations (FBI) among its clients.\" </em>Hence whilst we might believe that economically bitcoin can justify some upside, if the black market doesn\'t wish to use it due to it\'s trace-ability, it\'s almost surely worth much less than where it\'s currently trading.\r\n\r\nGiven the risks and hole in it\'s value proposition, we\'d be quite comfortable in passing on any opportunity to invest in bitcoin or its associated derivatives.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Is Bitcoin a bubble?', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '1201-revision-v1', '', '', '2018-08-23 11:33:02', '2018-08-23 11:33:02', '', 1201, 'http://vegacapital.net/new/uncategorized/1201-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
